I'm going to tell you a story about one of the most profound intellectual transformations in human history. A transformation that took place over the course of about 300 years from the time of Newton in the late 1600s to the present day. It's a story of how physics, the systematic study of matter, energy, space, and time gradually took over explanatory territory that was previously reserved for God. How questions that were once answered by invoking divine intervention came to be answered by mathematical laws and physical processes.

How the supernatural was slowly, methodically replaced by the natural. Now, I want to be very clear about what I'm saying and what I'm not saying. I'm not claiming that physics has disproven the existence of God. That's not what science does.

Science doesn't deal with the supernatural. Science deals with the natural world with things that can be observed, measured and tested. What I am saying is that over the past three centuries, the explanatory role of God, the function that God served in accounting for natural phenomena has been steadily diminished as physics has advanced. Things that were once inexplicable without divine intervention are now explained by physical laws.

gaps in our understanding that were once filled by God have been filled by physics. This is the story of how that happened and it's one of the most important stories in the history of human thought. I'm Leonard Suskin. I've been doing theoretical physics for over 50 years and I want to walk you through this intellectual revolution step by step showing you exactly how physics replaced God as the primary explanation for the workings of the universe.

Let's start at the beginning. Isaac Newton. Newton working in the late 1600s was one of the founders of modern physics. His laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the physical world.

For the first time, the motions of objects on Earth and the motions of celestial bodies in the heavens were governed by the same mathematical laws. An apple falling from a tree and the moon orbiting the earth, these were manifestations of the same force, gravity, described by the same equation. F= G * M1 * M2 / R 2. This was revolutionary.

Before Newton, the celestial realm, the sun, moon, planets, and stars, was thought to operate according to different principles than the terrestrial realm. Aristotle had taught that celestial bodies moved in perfect circles because they were made of a special fifth element, quintessence, which naturally moved in circular motion. Newton swept all that away. There was no distinction between terrestrial and celestial.

There was one set of laws governing everything. But here's what's interesting and what's crucial for our story. Newton himself believed that God was necessary to keep the universe running. Newton's universe consisted of the sun, planets, moons, and an infinite number of stars scattered throughout infinite space.

He worked out the gravitational forces between these bodies using his law of gravitation. and he realized there was a problem. The problem was gravitational instability. If you have a finite number of stars in infinite space, they'll all attract each other and eventually collapse into one giant mass.

That's unstable. Alternatively, if you have an infinite number of stars uniformly distributed through infinite space, you run into mathematical paradoxes. The gravitational force becomes undefined. Newton couldn't solve this problem with his physics.

He didn't have a way to make his infinite universe of stars stable using just the laws of mechanics and gravitation. So he invoked God. He argued that God must occasionally intervene in the universe to keep the stars properly distributed to maintain stability to prevent collapse. Divine intervention was a necessary part of the cosmological picture.

This bothered some of Newton's contemporaries. The German philosopher Gutfried Linnets criticized Newton for this. Linenets argued that if God had to intervene to keep the universe running smoothly, that implied God was a poor watchmaker, creating a mechanism that needed constant tinkering to keep it working. Newton defended his position.

He saw nothing wrong with God playing an active role in maintaining the universe. In fact, Newton saw this as evidence of God's ongoing presence and power. But the intellectual trajectory was clear. If you needed God to patch the holes in your physical theory, that suggested your physical theory was incomplete.

And as physics advanced, those holes started to get filled. Now, let's jump forward about a hundred years to the late 1700s and early 1800s. This is the era of Llass. Pierre Simon Llass was a French mathematician and astronomer.

He made enormous contributions to celestial mechanics, the study of how planets, moons, and comets move under gravitational forces. And Lelass succeeded where Newton had failed. He proved or thought he proved that the solar system was stable, that the orbits of planets wouldn't slowly drift or spiral out of control. that no divine intervention was needed to keep things running smoothly.

Legend has it that when Llas presented his great work, the mechanic celeste to Napoleon Bonapart, Napoleon asked him where God fit into his system. And Llas famously replied, genevoy deiipotees, I had no need of that hypothesis. Whether this exchange actually happened is disputed by historians, but it captures something true about Lelass's worldview. God was unnecessary.

Physics was sufficient. And Lelass went further. In 1814, he articulated what has become the classic statement of scientific determinism. He wrote, "We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future.

an intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion and all positions of all items of which nature is composed. If this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom. For such an intellect, nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. This hypothetical intellect came to be known as Lelass's demon and it represented a radically deterministic view of the universe.

According to Lelass, the universe was like a gigantic clockwork mechanism. Everything that happens is determined by the laws of physics and the initial conditions. If you knew those laws and conditions perfectly, you could predict everything past, present, and future. No randomness, no free will, no room for divine intervention.

This was a complete departure from the traditional religious view. In traditional theology, God could act in the world. Miracles were possible. Prayers could be answered.

The future was open, not determined. But in Lelass's universe, everything was locked in by physical law. The future was as fixed as the past. God wasn't needed to keep the universe running.

physics did all the work. Now, Lelass's determinism had some problems. Even in classical mechanics, there are cases where determinism breaks down systems where multiple solutions exist for the same initial conditions. Pone discovered some of these cases in 1806 and uh later in the late 1800s, Henri Poare discovered chaotic systems, systems that are deterministic in principle but unpredictable in practice because tiny changes in initial conditions lead to wildly different outcomes.

But these were seen as mathematical curiosities. The prevailing view in the 19th century was that the universe was deterministic. Physics governed everything. God was relegated to the role of first cause, the being who set up the initial conditions and the laws, but then stepped back and let the clockwork run.

And even that role was threatened by the next development, thermodynamics. In the mid 1800s, physicists developed the laws of thermodynamics, the science of heat, energy, and entropy. These laws had profound implications for cosmology. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy, roughly speaking, disorder always increases in a closed system.

Over time, energy becomes more spread out, more evenly distributed, less available to do useful work. This led to a disturbing conclusion about the fate of the universe. Heat death. If entropy always increases, then eventually the universe will reach a state of maximum entropy, maximum disorder, maximum uniformity.

All temperature differences will even out. No more energy flows. No more work, no more life, just a cold, dark, dead universe at uniform temperature. This was called the heat death of the universe and it became a major topic of discussion in the late 1800s.

But there was another implication that people noticed. If entropy always increases and if the universe is currently in a state of relatively low entropy, then the universe must have had a beginning. It can't have existed eternally in the past because if it had, it would already be in the maximum entropy state already dead. So the second law of thermodynamics suggested that the universe had a beginning, a moment of creation when entropy was very low and everything was highly organized.

This might seem to support the religious view. After all, the Bible says in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. But many scientists and philosophers in the late 1800s found this implication uncomfortable. They wanted an eternal universe, a universe without a beginning, a universe that didn't need a creator to bring it into existence.

Various proposals were made to avoid this conclusion. Maybe entropy only increases in certain regions but decreases in others, so the total stays constant. Maybe the universe undergoes cycles, expanding, contracting, bouncing, repeating forever. Maybe the laws of thermodynamics don't apply to the universe as a whole.

None of these proposals were very satisfying. But the idea of an eternal self-sufficient universe, a universe that didn't require divine creation, remained attractive to many thinkers. And then in the early 1900s, everything changed. The revolution began with Albert Einstein.

Einstein's theory of general relativity published in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of spaceime and gravity. Gravity wasn't a force in the Newtonian sense. It was the curvature of spaceime caused by mass and energy. Einstein applied his theory to cosmology to the universe as a whole.

And he found something unexpected. His equations predicted that the universe couldn't be static. It had to be either expanding or contracting. This bothered Einstein.

He like most scientists of his time believed in a static eternal universe. So he modified his equations adding a term called the cosmological constant to allow for a static solution. This was by Einstein's own later admission his biggest blunder. Because in the 1920s, observations began to show that the universe is expanding.

The American astronomer Edwin Hubble using the 1000 in telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory measured the distances and velocities of galaxies. And he discovered that distant galaxies are moving away from us. And the farther away they are, the faster they're receding. This is exactly what you'd expect if the universe is expanding.

If space itself is stretching, carrying galaxies along with it. And if the universe is expanding, then if you run the movie backward, everything was closer together in the past. Go back far enough and everything was in the same place. A moment of infinite density and infinite temperature, a beginning.

This became known as the Big Bang theory, though that name was originally meant as a derisive term coined by Fred Hy who opposed the idea. The Big Bang was initially resisted by many scientists precisely because it seemed to support religious cosmology. An eternal self-existent universe fit better with a naturalistic atheistic worldview. A universe with a beginning seemed to require a creator.

The Belgian physicist and Catholic priest Gor Lamett was one of the first to propose what we now call the big bang model. He called it the hypothesis of the primeval atom. Einstein after hearing Lamemetra present his ideas in 1933 stood up and applauded saying it was the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation I have ever heard. But Lamemeta himself cautioned against conflating science and theology.

He argued that the big bang was a scientific theory about the physical beginning of the universe, not a proof of divine creation. The idea that God created the universe was a theological claim, not a scientific one. Nevertheless, many scientists were uncomfortable with the Big Bang precisely because of its theological implications. Some tried to develop alternative models like the steady state theory proposed by Hy Gold and Bondi in 1948 that preserved an eternal universe.

But the evidence kept accumulating. In 1965, Arnold Pensas and Robert Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave background, the faint glow of radiation left over from the hot early universe. This was exactly what the big bang theory predicted and it effectively killed the steady state theory. The universe had a beginning about 13.8 billion years ago.

This is now firmly established science. So physics had uh answered one of the biggest questions that had previously been reserved for theology. Where did the universe come from? Not from divine creation, at least not in the direct sense of God speaking the universe into existence, but from a physical process, the expansion of space from an initial hot dense state.

But uh wait, didn't the big bang support the religious view? Doesn't the beginning imply a beginner? Not necessarily. And this is where physics took another step in replacing uh theological explanations.

The question, what caused the big bang or what came before the big bang turns out to be more subtle than it first appears. In general relativity, time itself is part of the physical universe. Time and space are woven together into spacetime. If the Big Bang was the beginning of spaceime, then there was no before.

Time itself began at the Big Bang. Asking what came before the Big Bang is like asking what's north of the North Pole. It's a malformed question. It presupposes something, a time before time that doesn't exist.

Moreover, in quantum mechanics, things can happen without causes in the traditional sense. Radioactive decay happens spontaneously. Particles can tunnel through barriers they don't have enough energy to overcome. Quantum fluctuations can create particle antiparticle pairs out of the vacuum.

Combining quantum mechanics with cosmology, some physicists, Stephven Hawking and James Hardle, for instance, have proposed models where the universe has no boundary, no edge, no beginning in the usual sense. Hawkings no boundary proposal treats time near the big bang as if it were a spatial dimension. The universe just is. No creation event needed.

Other physicists like Lawrence Krauss and Alex Filipenko have argued that the universe could have arisen from nothing through quantum fluctuations. The laws of quantum mechanics allow something to come from nothing, at least from the quantum vacuum, which is not really nothing but a seething sea of virtual particles. Now, these are all speculative ideas. We don't have a complete theory of quantum gravity yet.

We don't know for sure what happened at or before the Big Bang. But the point is, physics is providing possible naturalistic explanations for the origin of the universe. Explanations that don't require divine intervention. And then there's the multiverse.

Over the past few decades, physicists have increasingly come to take seriously the idea that our universe is not unique. that there might be a vast perhaps infinite number of universes each with different laws of physics, different constants of nature, different properties. This idea arises from several different lines of theoretical work, from eternal inflation in cosmology, from the string landscape and string theory, from the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. I've written about this extensively.

In my book, The Cosmic Landscape, I argued that string theory predicts about 10^ the 500 different possible vacuum states, different possible universes with different physics. And eternal inflation, a generic feature of most inflationary models, suggests that uh all of these possibilities are realized somewhere in a vast multiverse. If this picture is correct, then the question, why does our universe have the particular laws and constants it has is answered not by design but by selection. We live in this particular universe because it's one of the rare ones where conditions allow for life.

We couldn't exist in most other universes, so we necessarily find ourselves in one that's suitable. This is the anthropic principle and it's a purely naturalistic explanation for what might otherwise seem like divine fine-tuning. For centuries, theologians pointed to the apparent fine-tuning of the universe as evidence of God. The constants of nature seem exquisitly calibrated to allow for stars, planets, chemistry, and life.

Change any of them by a tiny amount, and life becomes impossible. Isn't this evidence of an intelligent designer? Doesn't the fine-tuning require a fine-tuner? Not if there's a multiverse.

In a multiverse with enough variation, some universes will have the right properties by chance. And those are the ones where observers will exist to wonder about it. No design needed, just probability and selection. Now, the multiverse is controversial.

Many physicists object to it on the grounds that other universes are unobservable and therefore unscientific. And that's a fair criticism. But the point is physics is offering naturalistic alternatives to theistic explanations. Let me step back and summarize where we are in this story.

Newton invoked God to maintain the stability of the universe. Llas showed that God was unnecessary. Physics could do the job. The second law of thermodynamics suggested the universe had a beginning, but physicists tried to avoid that conclusion.

The Big Bang confirmed the beginning, but quantum cosmology suggests it might not require a creator. Fine-tuning seems to point to design, but the multiverse offers a naturalistic alternative. At every step, physics has encroached on territory that was previously God's. Explanations that require the supernatural have been replaced by explanations that invoke only the natural.

But there's one more piece of the story I need to tell you about. Quantum mechanics and determinism. Remember Lelass's demon? The idea that the universe is deterministic, that the future is completely determined by the present, that everything is locked in by physical law.

Quantum mechanics destroyed that picture. In the 1920s, Vera Heisenberg discovered the uncertainty principle. You cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect precision. There's a fundamental limit not due to measurement error but built into the nature of reality itself.

And this uncertainty is not just about what we can know, it's about what is. Before you measure a quantum system, it doesn't have definite properties. It's in a superp position, a quantum combination of different states. Only when you measure does it collapse into a definite state.

And which state you get is fundamentally random. This was deeply disturbing to Einstein. He famously said, "God does not play dice." He believed that quantum mechanics was incomplete, that there must be hidden variables determining the outcomes, making everything deterministic underneath. But Einstein was wrong.

Experiments testing Bell's inequalities have confirmed that there are no hidden variables. Quantum mechanics really is fundamentally probabilistic. The universe really does have randomness built into it at the most basic level. This shattered the leloian dream.

Even if you knew the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, which the uncertainty principle says you can't, you still couldn't predict the future with certainty because quantum events are truly random. God doesn't play dice, Einstein said. But actually, according to quantum mechanics, the universe does play dice. Reality is fundamentally indeterministic.

Now, some people have tried to see this as leaving room for God or free will. If the universe is not deterministic, if the future is not fixed, maybe there's space for divine action or human choice. But that's not really how it works. The randomness in quantum mechanics is not the kind of randomness that gives you freedom or allows for divine intervention.

It's just random. It follows statistical rules described by the Schroinger equation, but individual outcomes are unpredictable. God has been replaced not by deterministic clockwork, but by probabilistic quantum mechanics. Either way, it's physics, not theology, that's doing the explaining.

Now, let me address the obvious question. If physics has replaced God as an explanation for natural phenomena, does that mean God doesn't exist? No, that's not what I'm saying. Physics explains how the universe works.

It doesn't explain why there's a universe at all. It doesn't explain why the laws of physics are what they are. It doesn't explain consciousness, meaning, value, purpose, at least not yet, and maybe not ever. There are still deep questions that physics can't answer.

Philosophical questions, metaphysical questions, questions about existence itself. Why is there something rather than nothing? Why do the laws of physics exist? Why is mathematics so effective at describing the physical world?

What is the nature of consciousness? Why does the universe seem comprehensible to us? Physics doesn't answer these questions. Maybe philosophy can, maybe theology can, maybe they're unanswerable.

My point is not that God doesn't exist. My point is that God is no longer needed as an explanation for physical phenomena. That's what physics replaced. For thousands of years, humans invoked gods to explain thunder, lightning, earthquakes, disease, the motions of planets, the origins of species.

As science advanced, these supernatural explanations were replaced by natural ones. Zeus didn't throw the lightning bolts electrical discharge in the atmosphere did. God didn't create species in their current forms. Evolution did.

God didn't place the planets in their orbits. Gravity and angular momentum did. This process has been called the God of the gaps problem. If you use God to explain gaps in scientific knowledge, those explanations disappear as science fills the gaps.

And over the past 300 years, physics has filled an enormous number of gaps. The motion of planets, the stability of the solar system, the nature of light, the structure of atoms, the origin of elements, the expansion of the universe, the beginning of time. All of these were once mysteries that might have seemed to require divine explanation. All are now explained by physics.

Now I want to talk about a parallel development in biology because it illustrates the same pattern and had enormous cultural impact. In 1859, Charles Darwin published on the origin of species and he did for biology what Newton and his successors did for physics. He provided a naturalistic explanation for phenomena that had previously seemed to require divine intervention. Before Darwin, the complexity and apparent design of living organisms seemed inexplicable without a creator.

The eye, the wing, the intricate structures of cells, how could these arise through natural processes? They seemed obviously designed. They pointed to an intelligent designer. This was the argument from design most famously articulated by William Paley in 1802.

Paley used the watchmaker analogy. If you found a watch lying on the ground, you would infer it had a maker. Similarly, when you observe the intricate complexity of living organisms, you should infer they had a maker god. Darwin showed this inference was wrong.

Natural selection, the differential survival and reproduction of organisms with heritable variations could produce complexity, adaptation, and the appearance of design without any actual designer. Random mutations provide variation. Natural selection filters that variation, preserving beneficial changes and eliminating harmful ones. Over millions of years, this process can produce eyes, wings, and all the complexity of life.

No designer needed, no divine intervention required, just natural processes operating according to natural laws. The cultural reaction to Darwin was intense. Many people felt that evolution undermined religion, undermined the special status of humans, undermined the entire moral and cosmic order. And in a sense, they were right.

Not that Darwin disproved God. He didn't. And that wasn't his aim. But he showed that God was unnecessary as an explanation for the origin of species.

Biology, like physics, could proceed without supernatural hypothesis. This is the same pattern we see in physics. Newton invoked God to explain the stability of the cosmos. Llas showed God was unnecessary.

Theologians pointed to the finetuning of the universe. The multiverse suggests design is unnecessary. The pattern repeats. Physics finds naturalistic explanations for what seemed to require the supernatural.

And this has had profound cultural consequences. In Western society, at least, the explanatory role of God has steadily diminished. Not because of any single discovery, but because of the cumulative weight of centuries of scientific progress. People still believe in God, of course, billions of people do.

But God's role has changed. God is no longer invoked to explain why lightning strikes or where species come from or how the planets move. Those are scientific questions with scientific answers. God has retreated to the realm of ultimate questions.

Questions about meaning, purpose, morality, existence itself. Questions that science doesn't address. Whether this is a healthy development or a tragic loss depends on your perspective, but it's the reality of how intellectual history has unfolded. Does this mean the universe is godless?

Not necessarily. But it does mean the universe is self-sufficient, at least in terms of its ongoing operation. The laws of physics are enough to explain how the universe works from the smallest quantum fluctuations to the largest cosmic structures. Whether those laws themselves require a divine lawgiver is a question physics can't answer.

That's metaphysics, not physics. But within the domain of physical explanation, within the realm of how things work, God has been replaced by physics. And that I think is one of the great intellectual achievements of the past three centuries. We've learned that the universe is comprehensible, that its workings can be understood through observation, experiment, and mathematical reasoning.

That we don't need to invoke the supernatural to explain the natural. That's the power of physics. And that's why physics replaced God not as an ultimate explanation for everything, but as the explanation for how the physical world operates. Thank you for listening.

The universe is comprehensible and that's miraculous
