I'm going to defend an idea that makes a lot of physicists uncomfortable. An idea that's been called unscientific, unfalsifiable, even a betrayal of the scientific method. An idea that some of my colleagues hate, where the passion that's almost religious in its intensity. The multiverse is real, not just possible, not just a mathematical curiosity, real.

And I'm going to explain why I'm convinced of this despite decades of criticism, despite the philosophical objections, despite the fact that it goes against every intuition we have about the uniqueness and simplicity in physical law. I'm Leonard Suskin and in 2005 I published a book called The Cosmic Landscape where I laid out the case for the multiverse and the anthropic principle. I've been working on this problem for my entire career on string theory, on black holes, on the fundamental structure of reality. And everything I've learned points in the same direction.

Our universe is not unique. It's one of an unimaginably vast number of universes. Uh each with different laws of physics, different constants of nature, different properties. Um, and we exist in this particular universe for one simple reason.

It's one of the rare ones where conditions allow for life. That's the anthropic principle. And it's not giving up on science. It's accepting what the mathematics is telling us.

Let me start with the problem that led me to the multiverse. It's called the finetuning problem and it's one of the deepest mysteries in all of physics. The constants of nature, the mass of the electron, the strength of the electromagnetic force, the cosmological constant, all of these fundamental numbers appear to be exquisitely fine-tuned to allow for the existence of complex structures like atoms, molecules, stars, and ultimately life. Let me give you some examples because the numbers are truly astonishing.

The cosmological constant also called dark energy is the energy density of empty space. Einstein uh introduced it in 1917 then called it his biggest blunder when Hubble discovered the uh the expanding universe. But in 1998 astronomers discovered that the expansion is accelerating. And the simplest explanation is a small positive cosmological constant.

How small? The measured value is about 10 to the minus 120 in plank units. That's a decimal point followed by 119 zeros, then a one. Now, here's the problem.

When you calculate what the cosmological constant should be using quantum field theory, when you add up all the contributions from vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, you get a number that's about 10^ the 120 times larger than what we observe. This is the worst prediction in the history of physics. Off by 120 orders of magnitude, it's not just wrong, it's catastrophically, incomprehensibly wrong. And here's the kicker.

If the cosmological constant were anywhere close to what quantum field theory predicts, the universe would have blown itself apart in the first fraction of a second, space would be expanding so fast that no structures, no galaxies, no stars, no planets, no atoms could ever form. The universe would be empty, dead, and utterly hostile to life. But the cosmological constant is not large. It's incredibly small.

just large enough to not interfere with structure formation, but small enough to not rip everything apart. It's finely tuned, precisely tuned, tuned to a part in 10^ the 120. That's one example. Let me give you another.

The mass of the electron is about 511 kilo electron volts. The mass of the proton is about 938 million electron volts, about 1,836 times heavier. This ratio, the mass of the proton to the mass of the electron, is about 1,836. Why, 1836?

We have no idea. It's a free parameter in the standard model of particle physics. We measure it, we plug it into our equations, and the equations work. But uh we can't derive it from first principles.

And here's what's disturbing. If this ratio was significantly different, if the electron were heavier or the proton were lighter, atoms wouldn't work the way they do. Chemistry would be completely different. Complex molecules, the molecules necessary for life, might not be able to form at all.

If the electron were just a few% heavier, hydrogen atoms couldn't exist. Electrons would fall into the nucleus and combine with protons to make neutrons. No hydrogen means no water, no organic chemistry, no life as we know it. If the proton were just a little lighter, it would be unstable.

Protons would decay into neutrons, posetrons, and nutrinos. Again, no hydrogen, no chemistry, no life. The ratio is fine-tuned, precisely calibrated to allow for the complex chemistry that makes life possible. I could give you dozens more examples.

The strength of the strong nuclear force, the strength of the weak nuclear force, the Higs mass, the number of dimensions of space. All of these parameters seem to be tuned often to astonishing precision to allow for stars, planets, and life. This is the fine-tuning problem and it's a genuine mystery. Why are the laws of physics the way they are?

Why these particular values for the fundamental constants? Why a universe that's hospitable to life instead of a dead empty void? For decades, physicists have looked for explanations. Maybe there's some deeper principle, some symmetry, some mathematical structure that requires these values.

Maybe string theory will explain it. Maybe there's a grand unified theory that deres all the constants from a single simple principle. And maybe that's true. I hope it is.

That would be elegant. That would be beautiful. That would satisfy our aesthetic sense that the universe should be simple and unique. But here's what we've discovered over the past few decades.

And here's why I've changed my mind about uniqueness. String theory doesn't give us a unique universe. It gives us a vast landscape of possible universes. Let me explain what I mean by the string landscape because this is central to everything that follows.

String theory is a candidate for a unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity. Instead of point particles, the fundamental objects are tiny vibrating strings. Different vibration modes correspond to different particles, electrons, photons, quarks, gravitons, all emerging from the same underlying strings. For a long time, string theorists hoped, believed really that string theory would be unique, that there would be one and only one way to formulate a consistent string theory.

and that this unique theory would predict the masses of particles, the values of coupling constants, everything. But it didn't work out that way. In the 1990s, we discovered that there are many string theories. Type I, type I A, type IB, heterotic SO32, heterotic E8* E8.

And all of these theories are connected by dualities, mathematical transformations that relate one theory to another. Then we discovered M theory which unifies all these string theories into a single framework. But M theory doesn't eliminate the multiplicity, it reveals it. And most importantly, we discovered that string theory has an enormous number of vacuum states.

A vacuum state is a solution to the equations, a stable configuration of the strings and the fields they create. Different vacuum states correspond to different physics, different particle masses, different force strengths, different values for the cosmological constant. How many vacuum states are there? The estimates vary, but the most commonly cited number is about 10^ the 500.

That's 10^ the 500th power. A number so large it's almost meaningless to try to comprehend it. For comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe is about 10 to the 80. The number of plon volumes in the observable universe is about 10^ the 185.

The landscape of string theory dwarfs both of these by factors that are themselves unimaginably large. Each of these 10^ the 500 vacuum states is a different possible universe, different laws of physics, different constants, different properties. And somewhere in this vast landscape, somewhere in this unimaginably huge space of possibilities, there are vacuum states, where the cosmological constant is small, where the electron to proton mass ratio is about 1,836, where the forces have the right strengths, where the uh conditions are right for stars, planets, and life. This is the string landscape and it's not speculation.

It's a direct consequence of the mathematics of string theory combined with our understanding of how vacuum states can form in quantum field theory. Now, here's where eternal inflation comes in because the landscape alone isn't enough. You need a mechanism to populate the landscape to actually create physical universes corresponding to these different vacuum states. And eternal inflation provides exactly that mechanism.

Inflation is a theory proposed by Alan Guth in 1980 though similar ideas were developed around the same time by Andre Linday and others. The basic idea is that in the very early universe there was a period of exponential expansion in a tiny fraction of a second space expanded by an enormous factor perhaps 10^ the 60 or more. This inflationary expansion solved several problems with standard big bang cosmology. It explained why the universe is so flat, so homogeneous, so isotropic.

It explained where the density fluctuations that seated galaxy formation came from. But here's what's crucial. Almost all models of inflation don't just inflate once and stop. They inflate eternally.

They keep inflating forever, creating more and more space. Here's how it works. Inflation is driven by a field called the inflaton. When this field is in a high energy state, it drives exponential expansion.

Eventually, the inflaton decays into ordinary matter and radiation. Inflation ends and you get a big bang, a hot expanding universe. But quantum fluctuations can kick the inflaton back up to the high energy state in some regions. And when that happens, those regions inflate again, creating new space.

And within that new space, more quantum fluctuations create more inflating regions. It's a never-ending process. The result is a fractal branching structure. Some regions stop inflating and become pocket universes, regions like our observable universe.

But other regions keep inflating, spawning more pocket universes forever. Now combine eternal inflation with the string landscape. As inflation proceeds, different regions can decay into different vacuum states from the landscape. One region might decay into a vacuum with a large cosmological constant.

Another might decay into a vacuum where the electron is heavy. Another might decay into a vacuum with different force strengths. The result is a multiverse. An eternal everexpanding structure containing an infinite number of pocket universes each with different physics sampled from the vast landscape of string theory.

And this is not optional. This is not something you can avoid by tweaking the parameters. Eternal inflation is generic. It happens in almost every model of inflation that anyone has ever proposed.

You have to fine-tune the model very carefully to prevent eternal inflation. And in physics, when you have to fine-tune to avoid something, that usually means nature doesn't fine-tune. Nature goes with the generic case. So, we have a multiverse, an infinite collection of universes with different laws of physics.

And now, the fine-tuning problem has a natural explanation. We don't live in a typical universe. We can't live in a typical universe. Most universes in the multiverse don't have the right conditions for life.

The cosmological constant is too large or the electron is too heavy or the forces have the wrong strengths. Those universes are empty, sterile, dead. We live in one of the rare universes perhaps 1 in 10 to the 120 or 1 in 10 to the 500 depending on how you count where conditions happen to be right where the constants happen to have values that allow for stars, planets, chemistry and life. This is the anthropic principle.

We observe a life- friendly universe not because the universe was designed for life but because we couldn't exist in any other kind of universe. Our existence selects for the rare special universes in the landscape. Now, I know what you're thinking. I've heard all the objections.

Let me address them one by one. Objection one, the multiverse is unfalsifiable. You can't test it. Therefore, it's not science.

My response, this is based on a misunderstanding of how science works. Science is not just about making predictions and testing them in experiments. Science is about explaining observations using the best available theories. We can't directly observe electrons.

We can't directly observe quarks. We can't directly observe the interior of the Sunday, but we infer their existence from indirect evidence. We use theoretical frameworks to explain what we do observe. The multiverse is the same.

We can't directly observe other universes. They're causally disconnected from us beyond our cosmic horizon. But we can infer existence from the theoretical framework of string theory plus eternal inflation. And the multiverse does make predictions.

It predicts that the constants of nature we observe should be typical among the subset of universes that can support observers. It predicts that we shouldn't observe any constants that are unnecessarily fine-tuned beyond what's required for life. Steven Weinberg in 1987, before anyone knew about the string landscape, used anthropic reasoning to predict the value of the cosmological constant. He argued that it should be small enough to allow galaxy formation, but not much smaller because there's no anthropic reason for it to be smaller.

His prediction was off by only a factor of a few. In 1998, when dark energy was discovered, Weineberg's anthropic prediction was vindicated. That's a testable prediction. And it was confirmed.

Objection two, the anthropic principle is giving up. It's abandoning the search for a deeper explanation. My response, no, it's accepting what the math is telling us. [snorts] If string theory really does have 10^ the 500 vacuum states and if eternal inflation really does populate them, then the anthropic principle is not giving up.

It's the explanation. Look, I'd love to find a deeper principle that explains why our vacuum is special. I'd love to discover some symmetry or dynamical mechanism that picks out a particular set of constants. That would be beautiful.

That would be elegant. But after decades of searching, we haven't found it. String theory doesn't give us uniqueness. It gives us multiplicity.

And we have to deal with that honestly. The anthropic principle is not giving up on explanation. It's recognizing that the explanation might be statistical rather than dynamical, environmental rather than fundamental. Objection three.

The multiverse is ugly. It's inelegant. Science should be about finding simple, beautiful laws. My response, nature doesn't care about our aesthetic preferences.

The universe is under no obligation to be elegant. And actually, I think the multiverse is elegant in a different way. It's elegant because it doesn't require fine-tuning. It doesn't require miraculous coincidences.

It doesn't require some cosmic designer carefully adjusting the dials to make the constants come out right. The multiverse explains fine-tuning through probability. If you have enough universes with enough variation, some of them will have the right properties by chance. And those are the ones where observers will exist to wonder about it.

That's actually a very satisfying explanation. It removes the mystery. It turns a deep puzzle into a straightforward consequence of large numbers. You know, I wrote the cosmic landscape in 2005 and I took a lot of heat for it.

A lot of physicists, people I respect, people whose work I admire told me I was giving up, that I was abandoning the search for a theory of everything. That I was making excuses for string theory's failure to predict anything. And I understand where they're coming from. I really do.

The dream of a unique theory of everything, a single simple set of equations that explains all the constants of nature. That's a beautiful dream. I had that dream too. But science is not about dreams.

Science is about following the evidence wherever it leads. And the evidence from string theory, from inflation, from cosmology, all points toward a multiverse. Now, let me address one more thing because I think it's important. Some people hear multiverse and they imagine parallel worlds where you made different choices or where history went differently or where the Nazis won World War II.

That's not what I'm talking about. That's science fiction. The multiverse I'm describing is much stranger and much more interesting. These aren't parallel Earths with small differences.

These are fundamentally different universes with different laws of physics. In some universes, electrons are heavier than protons. In some universes, there are four dimensions of space instead of three. In some universes, the strong force is stronger or the weak forces weaker.

These aren't tweaks. These are radical differences that make those universes look nothing like ours. Most of these universes are sterile, empty, dead. No stars, no planets, no chemistry, no life, no observers.

We exist in one of the rare universes where the constants happen to be right. And that's not because we're special. It's because we couldn't exist anywhere else. It's selection bias on a cosmic scale.

Let me end by talking about what the multiverse means for the future of physics. Some people think the multiverse is the end of physics. That once you invoke the anthropic principle, there's nothing left to predict, nothing left to calculate, nothing left to discover. But that's completely wrong.

The multiverse opens up entirely new questions. How does eternal inflation work in detail? What determines which vacuum states are more probable than others? Can we calculate the distribution of constants across the landscape?

Are there any constants that can't be explained anthropically and therefore must have deeper explanations? These are hard questions. They require new mathematical tools, new physical insights, new experimental tests, but they're scientific questions. real concrete answerable questions.

And we're making progress. People are working on the statistics of the landscape, on the dynamics of eternal inflation, on how quantum mechanics applies to the multiverse as a whole, on what predictions we can extract from anthropic reasoning. This is active, vibrant, cutting edge physics. It's not giving up.

It's exploring uncharted territory. The multiverse is real. I'm convinced of it. Not because I want it to be true, but because the mathematics forces it on us.

String theory gives us the landscape. Inflation populates it. And we observe exactly the kind of universe we'd expect to find ourselves in. One of the rare ones that can support life.

That's not a failure of physics. That's physics telling us something profound about the nature of reality. Thank you for listening. The multiverse is real and it's one of the most important discoveries in the history of science.
