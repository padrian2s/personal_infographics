Time is the most familiar thing in the universe. You've been experiencing it your entire life. Right now, as you watch this video, time is passing. Seconds are ticking.

The future is becoming the present, and the present is becoming the past. You feel it happening. You live inside it. You cannot escape it.

And yet, time doesn't exist. Not in the way you think it does. Not as a fundamental feature of physical reality. Not as the universal river you imagine yourself floating in.

Not as the backdrop against which all events play out. In the deepest physical theories we have, the ones that describe the universe at the most fundamental level, time disappears. It drops out of the equations. It becomes unnecessary.

It might be, as Julian Barbour has argued in one of the most serious and rigorous books ever written about the subject, nothing more than an illusion. A very persistent, very convincing, very universal illusion, but an illusion nonetheless. I know this sounds like philosophy, like word play, like the kind of thing people say to sound profound at dinner parties. It isn't.

It's the conclusion you reach when you take seriously the two greatest physical theories ever developed, general relativity and quantum mechanics, and try to combine them into a single coherent picture of reality. When you do that combination, time drops out. The universe described by quantum gravity is a universe without time. Everything we think of as temporal change, motion, causality, before and after, the flow of experience, all of it requires explanation.

not as fundamental features of reality, as emergent phenomena, things that appear from a deeper timeless substrate. After 50 years working at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity, wrestling with black holes and entropy and information and the structure of spaceime, I've come to believe this is one of the deepest and most underappreciated truths in all of physics. Time doesn't exist. Let me show you why.

two theories, one catastrophic problem. Let me start with the conflict that reveals the problem. General relativity is our theory of space-time and gravity. It describes how matter and energy curve the geometry of four-dimensional spaceime and how that curvature tells matter how to move.

It has been tested with exquisite precision gravitational waves, black holes, the expansion of the universe, the bending of light around massive objects, GPS corrections. It works. In general relativity, time is part of spaceime. It's one of four dimensions.

It's flexible. It stretches and compresses depending on gravitational fields and velocities, but it exists. Each point in spacetime has a time coordinate. Events happen at specific spac-time locations.

Causality is built into the light cone structure of spacetime. Quantum mechanics is a theory of matter at the smallest scales. It describes particles as wave functions evolving through a fixed background. It works with supernatural precision.

The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron predicted to 12 decimal places. It works. In quantum mechanics, time is an external parameter, a clock on the wall of the laboratory ticking away uniformly, providing the backdrop against which the Schroinger equation evolves the quantum state. In standard quantum mechanics, time is not an operator like positional momentum.

It's a classical background variable. It's absolute, fixed, given. Now combine them. Try to write down a quantum theory of gravity.

A theory where spacetime itself is the quantum system. Where the geometry of the universe is described by a wave function where there's no fixed background to provide a time parameter. The problem is immediate, catastrophic, fundamental. In general relativity, there's no preferred time coordinate.

Spacetime is covariant. All coordinate systems are equivalent, including all choices of time. Different slicings of spaceime into spatial surfaces at successive times are all equally valid. There's no universal win.

In quantum mechanics, the Schroinger equation says the wave function evolves in time. I dt equals s. Time is the external parameter. Evolution is with respect to time.

How do you write the Schroinger equation for the universe when there's no external time? When time is part of what you're trying to describe quantum mechanically, you can't, not directly. The naive combination fails. The Wheeler Dit equation and timelessness.

In the 1960s, John Wheeler and Bryce Dit tried to write down the fundamental equation of quantum gravity. What they got was something extraordinary and disturbing. The Wheeler Dit equation is S equals Z. The Hamiltonian operator acting on the wave function of the universe equals zero.

Look at what's missing. There's no de te on the right hand side. There's no time derivative. There's no time variable at all.

In ordinary quantum mechanics, the Schroinger equation says the Hamiltonian generates time evolution. S= E dt. The Hamiltonian tells you how the state changes with time. In the Wheel of Dit equation, the Hamiltonian acting on the universal wave function gives zero.

The state doesn't change with time. It can't there's no time for it to change with respect to the wave function of the universe is static, timeless. When Wheeler first saw this result, he reportedly walked around muttering, "Time has no meaning at the plank scale." Dit was deeply troubled. They both recognized what the equation was saying.

At the most fundamental level of quantum gravity, there is no time. The universe described by the Wheeler Dit equation is a single static quantum state. No evolution, no before, no after. A wave function that assigns amplitudes to different three-dimensional geometries of space.

But those geometries just exist simultaneously in quantum superposition. They don't evolve. They simply are. This is one of the most disturbing results in all of theoretical physics.

And it's not a fringe speculation. It follows from taking general relativity and quantum mechanics seriously and trying to combine them. Where does time come from? If the fundamental equation of quantum gravity has no time, then time must emerge from something timeless.

But how? This is called the problem of time in quantum gravity. And it's been one of the central challenges in the field for 60 years. Here's the most developed answer, relational time.

The idea was proposed by Dit himself and developed by many others, most influentially by Carlo Ralli and Julian Barbour. The key insight, we never measure time directly. We measure change. We measure correlations between physical systems.

Think about what a clock actually does. A clock is a physical system pendulum, crystal oscillator, seesium atom that goes through a periodic cycle. We measure time by counting those cycles and comparing other processes to them. What time is it?

really means how many oscillations has this cesium atom completed since we last synchronized. Time is defined relationally through correlations between physical systems in a timeless universe described by the wheel of the wit equation. There's no external time, but there are correlations between different degrees of freedom in the universal wave function. Some degrees of freedom play the role of clocks.

They correlate systematically with other degrees of freedom creating an internal notion of before and after. The expansion of the universe is one such clock. When we say something happened a billion years after the big bang, we mean it happened when the universe had a particular size, a particular density. Size stands in for time.

This is relational time. Time is not a fundamental background. It's a relationship between physical systems. It emerges from correlations in the universal wave function.

From the outside, from the God's eye view of the wheel of the wit equation, there is no time. There's a static wave function. But from the inside, from the perspective of an observer who is herself part of the universe, she experiences time as the correlation between her internal state, her memory, her clocks, her biological processes, and other degrees of freedom around her. Time is internal, relative, emergent, not fundamental.

Julian Barber and Plutonia. Let me tell you about Julian Barbour because he's thought about this more carefully and more radically than almost anyone else. Barber is a British physicist who for decades worked independently supported by translation work pursuing what he was convinced was the deepest problem in physics, the nature of time. In his book, The End of Time, published in 1999, Barber argues that time is completely and absolutely absent from the fundamental description of reality.

His framework, the universe at any moment is a configuration, a specification of where everything is relative to everything else. He calls the space of all possible configurations Platonia, not a place in space or time, a mathematical space. Each point in Platonia is a possible now, a complete snapshot of the universe. In Barbara's picture, the universe is not a sequence of configurations evolving through time.

It's a probability distribution over all configurations in Platonia. The wave function of the universe assigns amplitudes to different configurations. Some are more probable, some less. The experience of time, the feeling of moving from one moment to the next arises because high amplitude configurations contain records of lower amplitude configurations.

The configurations that are most probable in Barbara's framework are ones that contain what he calls time capsules. Internal structures that look like histories that encode apparent records of a past that seem to remember a sequence of events. You experience time because you are a configuration, a particular arrangement of matter that contains detailed records of what appear to be earlier configurations. your memories, your physical traces of past events, the entropy gradient you observe.

All of these are internal features of your configuration, not records of something that actually happened sequentially, just features of this configuration that look like records. This is radical. It says there is no past. There was no sequence.

There are just configurations, some of which contain apparent records of a past. The past is an illusion encoded in the present configuration. I find this both fascinating and deeply uncomfortable. But the discomfort doesn't make it wrong.

The thermodynamic arrow is not time. Let me address the most powerful objection to the claim that time doesn't exist. But entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics is real.

Eggs break and don't unbreak. Causes precede effects. The past is different from the future. Doesn't this mean time is real?

Yes. The thermodynamic arrow of time is real. The asymmetry between past and future is real. But, and this is the crucial distinction, the thermodynamic arrow is not the same thing as time.

The thermodynamic arrow tells you about a gradient in entropy across configurations. Our universe started in a very low entropy state. It has been moving toward higher entropy ever since. This gradient, this systematic difference between low entropy configurations in one direction and high entropy configurations in the other is what we call the arrow of time.

But this gradient exists within the timeless structure. In Barbara's language, among all configurations in Platonia, the high amplitude ones are clustered in a way that shows systematic entropy variation. The configurations that are most probable form chains, sequences of configurations where entropy increases along the chain. An observer inside such a chain experiences entropy increasing.

She calls that direction the future. She remembers lower entropy configurations because her configuration contains encoded information about them. She calls those memories the past. But the chain itself doesn't evolve.

It doesn't move through time. All configurations in the chain exist simultaneously. In Plutonia, the observer's experience of moving through them is an illusion created by the chainlike structure of high amplitude configurations. The arrow of time is real.

Time is not. This distinction between the experience directionality of change and the existence of fundamental time is the most important conceptual separation in the philosophy of physics. Almost everyone conflates them. They shouldn't.

General relativity already hints at timelessness. Even before quantum gravity, general relativity was already suggesting that time is not fundamental. In general relativity, there's no preferred time coordinate. Different observers in relative motion or in different gravitational fields measure different times.

We accept this time dilation as real and measured daily in particle accelerators and GPS systems. But there's a stronger version of this. In general relativity, the equations, the Einstein field equations can be rewritten in a way that makes no reference to time at all. This is the ADM formalism developed by Richard Arnowit, Stanley Desert and Charles Mner in the 1960s.

They showed that general relativity can be recast as a Hamiltonian system where the Hamiltonian is a constraint that equals zero. This is where the wheel of the wit equation comes from. The zero Hamiltonian. The zero Hamiltonian means there's no time evolution.

The system is frozen. All the dynamics, everything that looks like change when you're inside the system is actually relational. It's the change of one variable relative to another, not change in an external time. In general relativity, the universe is already a timeless structure.

In this sense, the appearance of time evolution is an artifact of how we choose to parameterize the solutions. Different parameterizations give different times. The physics, the physical content is in the relationships between physical quantities, not in their evolution with respect to an external time. Quantum mechanics reveals this timelessness more starkly, but general relativity was already pointing at it.

Loop quantum gravity and spin foam. In loop quantum gravity, the most developed alternative to string theory for quantum gravity, this timelessness is made completely explicit. In the spin foam formalism of loop quantum gravity, the universe is described by a mathematical structure called a spin foam. This is a kind of four-dimensional network, a graph of nodes connected by links with quantum numbers assigned to those links.

There's no time in this structure. The spin foam is a complete history of the universe, but it's not a history that unfolds in time. It's a static mathematical object, a four-dimensional structure, a complete specification of the quantum geometry of spaceime. What we experience as temporal evolution is our reading of the spin foam from inside it.

We're one small region of the spin foam, observing correlations between our local degrees of freedom and others. Those correlations create our experience of a temporal sequence. But from outside, from the mathematical structures perspective, there is no sequence. There's just the spin foam, static, complete, timeless.

Carlo Ralli uh one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has written beautifully about this. In his book, The Order of Time, he argues that time is not fundamental, that it emerges from thermodynamics and quantum correlations, that the fundamental laws of physics don't distinguish past from future and don't require a time variable. I don't agree with Rolli on everything. We've had productive disagreements over the years, but on this central point, I think he's right.

The fundamental description is timeless entropy and the birth of time. If time is not fundamental, where does our experience of it come from? Why is it so vivid, so universal, so impossible to escape? The answer lies in entropy and the initial conditions of our universe.

The universe began in a state of extremely low entropy. The Big Bang was a remarkably smooth ordered low entropy initial configuration. Since then entropy has been increasing. This entropy gradient creates the arrow of time we experience.

But more than that it creates memory. Low entropy in the past and high entropy in the present means that the present configuration contains records traces of the lower entropy past. Your memories exist because entropy has been increasing. Your brain at high entropy contains encoded information about lower entropy past states.

That's what memory is. And anticipation, your sense of an open, undetermined future, exists because you can't have memories of the future. High entropy configurations don't contain records of even higher entropy configurations. The future is genuinely unknown because records don't flow backward along the entropy gradient.

So the experience of time is entirely a consequence of the entropy gradient. Given the entropy gradient, you will inevitably experience something that feels like time. A past that is known and fixed, a present that is current, a future that is open and unknown. But the entropy gradient is itself just a feature of the configuration we're in.

It's not fundamental time, it's entropy. The experience of time is the experience of being in a low entropy universe that is increasing toward high entropy. If we started in a high entropy universe, if the big bang had been a maximal entropy configuration, there would be no entropy gradient. No memories, no arrow, no experience of time.

Time as we experience it is borrowed from entropy. When the universe reaches maximum entropy, heat death entropy stops increasing. The arrow of time disappears. Not because time ends, but because the gradient that creates the experience of time is gone.

In a maximum entropy universe, there's no before and after, no causality in the experience sense, no memory, no anticipation. Not because time ends, but because what we called time was always just entropy in disguise. Quantum mechanics and the now. Quantum mechanics adds another layer to the timelessness argument.

In standard quantum mechanics, measurement collapses the wave function. Before measurement, the system is in a superp position. After measurement, it's in a definite state. This collapse happens now at a specific moment.

Um, but what is now? In special relativity, simultaneity is relative. Different observers have different nows. There's no universal present moment.

The tension between quantum mechanics and relativity creates a problem. If wave function collapse is instantaneous, if it happens now and if now is different for different observers, then different observers would see different collapses at different times. The physics would be observer dependent in a way that seems inconsistent. Various resolutions have been proposed.

The many worlds interpretation avoids this by denying collapse. The wave function never collapses. Every outcome happens in some branch. There's no special now of collapse.

There's just a timeless universal wave function and our experience of being in one branch. In the many worlds picture, time is even more clearly emergent. The universal wave function is timeless. It satisfies the Wheeler Dwit equation.

Each branch corresponds to a sequence of configurations. Observers in each branch experience time as the correlation between their internal states and the configuration they're in. But there's no external time, no universal clock, no fact about which moment is now across all branches. What doesn't exist when time doesn't exist?

Let me be precise about what I mean when I say time doesn't exist because it's easy to misunderstand this claim. I'm not saying that change doesn't happen. Change is real configurations differ from each other. Different regions of the universal wave function have different properties.

Uh I'm not saying that causality doesn't exist. Causal structure is built into space-time geometry. Events that are space-like separated can't influence each other. Events in each other's light cones can.

Causality is a geometric fact. I'm not saying that memory is an illusion. Memory is a real physical phenomenon. Information encoded in current configurations about past configurations.

Um, I'm not saying that the future is determined. Quantum mechanics introduces genuine randomness. The future is not fixed. What I am saying is that there is no external time flowing, no universal clock ticking, no background against which events occur sequentially, no fact independent of physical correlations about when something is happening.

Time in the sense of an absolute external fundamental parameter, the Newtonian sense, does not exist. What exists instead? Configurations, correlations between configurations, entropy gradients, causal structure, memory, and the experience of observers inside the quantum state who perceive these correlations as temporal sequence. This is the timeless universe, not a universe where nothing happens.

A universe where everything that happens is relational, internal, emergent, block universe plus timelessness. I spoke in another video about the block universe. The idea emerging from special relativity that all events in spaceime exist equally. Past, present, and future are all equally real, equally part of the four-dimensional structure.

The timelessness argument goes further than the block universe. The block universe says all times exist equally. The present is not special. Past and future are as real as now.

The timelessness argument says time itself is not fundamental. The fourdimensional block is not a universe with four dimensions including one time dimension. It's a mathematical structure with four dimensions, one of which we call time because it has a special relationship with entropy. In the deepest picture, there is no space-time.

There are quantum states of geometry. Those states assign amplitudes to different configurations. In the high amplitude configurations, there are correlations that look like temporal sequences. We experience those correlations as time.

But the underlying structure, the wave function, the spin foam, the mathematical object that really exists has no time in it. This is a further step beyond the block universe. The block universe is timeless in the sense that all moments are equally real, but it still has a time dimension, a direction in the four-dimensional structure that we identify with temporal experience. The wheel of the wit timelessness is more radical.

Not even that structure is fundamental. It's emergent. It arises from something that has no time dimension at all. Roelli's thermal time hypothesis.

Here's one of the most creative ideas that has emerged from thinking about timeless physics. The thermal time hypothesis proposed by Alen Connis and Carlo Ralli. The idea in statistical mechanics, there's a special parameter associated with thermal equilibrium states. When a system is in a state of thermal equilibrium, there's a canonical mathematical structure, the KMS state that defines a natural flow.

This flow is generated by the modular Hamiltonian of the thermal state. Connelli proposed that this is what time is. Time is the thermal parameter associated with the thermal state of the universe, not a fundamental feature of the equations. A statistical feature of the quantum state.

In a system far from thermal equilibrium like our universe, which started in a very low entropy state, there's a preferred thermal time that corresponds approximately to ordinary time as we experience it. In a system of thermal equilibrium, maximum entropy, the thermal time is still defined mathematically, but there's no experience of it because there are no thermal gradients, no correlations that register as memories or as temporal flow. This is beautiful. It ties together the statistical mechanical origin of times arrow with the quantum gravitational timelessness.

Time is what you measure with a clock. And a clock is a physical system that exploits thermal gradients to track its own evolution. Take away the thermal gradients and you take away time. I'm not certain this is the full answer.

The thermal time hypothesis has problems. It works cleanly in some contexts and becomes ambiguous in others, but it points in the right direction. It's the kind of idea that even if wrong in detail, illuminates something true about the relationship between time and thermodynamics. Why we experience time so vividly?

Here's what I think is the hardest question about timeless physics. If time doesn't fundamentally exist, why do I experience it so vividly? The present moment feels real in a way nothing else does. The past feels gone and fixed.

The future feels open and undetermined. The flow of time second by second, moment by moment, is the most immediate datim of experience, more immediate than space. more immediate than matter, more immediate than anything. How can this experience be an illusion?

Not a trick of perception, but the deepest truth I know. The answer, and I think it's correct, though disturbing, is that your experience is exactly what you should expect from an information processing system embedded in a low entropy universe with an entropy gradient. You are a uh configuration of matter, an extraordinarily complex one. Your brain processes information.

It takes in sensory data, updates its model of the world, forms memories, generates predictions. All of this processing is physical. It happens according to physical laws. Because your universe has an entropy gradient, your processing has a direction.

Information flows from low entropy to high entropy. Your memories encode information about lower entropy past configurations. Your predictions are uncertain because higher entropy future configurations are many and varied. The experience of the present moment is the experience of your brain's current processing state.

The state in which sensory information is being integrated, models are being updated, decisions are being made. The past is what's been processed and stored. The future is what hasn't been processed yet. The vividness of the present moment is a feature of your information processing.

It's the moment of maximum relevance for your computational processes. Of course, it feels vivid. It's where the action is computationally speaking. And the flow of time, the sense of moving from moment to moment is the experience of these processing states occurring in sequence.

Each processing state is correlated with the next. The correlations create the phenomenology of flow. None of this requires fundamental time. All of it can be explained by entropy gradients and information processing in a timeless quantum state.

What this means for physics. Let me tell you what the timelessness of fundamental physics means for how we do physics. First, we need to reformulate physics without time. General relativity already points toward this with its diffmorphism invariance and constraint Hamiltonian.

Quantum gravity takes it further. The ultimate physical theory should not have time as a fundamental variable. It should describe static relationships between physical quantities with time emerging as a derived concept. This is a massive research program partially accomplished partially not.

Second, the problem of time and quantum gravity is not solved. The wheel of the wit equation exists, but it's poorly defined and has enormous technical problems. Loop quantum gravity spin foam approach is more rigorous, but still incomplete. String theory has its own approach through holography and addis CTF where time in the bulk emerges from the timeless conformal field theory on the boundary.

Each approach has successes and failures. None is complete. The problem of time remains one of the deepest unsolved problems in all of physics. Third, our intuitions about time are not just unreliable, they're actively misleading.

The progress that has been made on quantum gravity has come from people willing to follow the mathematics into deeply counterintuitive territory. Timelessness is counterintuitive. accepting it, really accepting it requires abandoning something that feels like the most basic datim of experience. But physics is full of this.

The earth moves though it feels still. The sun doesn't rise, though it appears to. Time is relative, though it feels absolute. And now time doesn't fundamentally exist, though it feels more real than anything.

The universe doesn't owe us intuitiveness. The deep question. Let me end with the deepest question that timelessness raises. Not a physics question, a philosophical one, but one that physics forces upon us.

If time doesn't fundamentally exist, if the flow of time is emergent from entropy gradients and relational correlations, if the present moment is a feature of information processing rather than a fundamental reality, then what is experience? What is consciousness if not the thing that exists in the present moment? Moving through time, accumulating memories, anticipating futures. The standard model of consciousness is deeply temporal.

You are the thing that experiences time. Consciousness is the screen on which the present moment appears. Take away time and you take away the stage on which experience happens. But the physics says there is no stage.

There is no external time for experience to happen in. There is only the static quantum state and the correlations within it and the entropy gradient and the information processing. Does experience itself exist? Is there a fact about what it's like to be you right now in this moment?

If there is no fundamental moment, I think the answer is yes. But it requires us to locate experience not in an external time but in the correlations themselves. You experience what it's like to be this configuration with these memories, with these sensory inputs, with this anticipation of a future. That experience is real.

It's encoded in the configuration. But uh it's not happening at a time. It's just a property of the configuration of this particular point in Platonia to use Barbara's language. This particular node in the spin foam, this particular branch of the universal wave function, you are a timeless thing that contains the experience of time, not a thing that exists in time, a thing whose internal structure encodes temporal experience.

This is strange. It's possibly the strangest conclusion in all of physics, and it's where the equations lead. Conclusion. Let me tell you what 50 years of thinking about quantum gravity has taught me about time.

Time is not fundamental. The deepest equations we have, the wheel of the wit equation, the spin foam formalism, the holographic principle contain no fundamental time variable. Time is absent at the quantum gravitational level. What we call time is the experience of entropy gradients, relational correlations, and information processing in a universe that began in an extraordinarily low entropy state.

It is real as an experience. It is real as a thermodynamic phenomenon. It is not real as a fundamental feature of the universe. This doesn't mean nothing happens.

Configurations exist. Correlations between configurations exist. Some configurations contain records of other configurations. Some physical processes are irreversible because of entropy.

Causality is built into space-time geometry. All of this is real. What doesn't exist is the external clock, the background time, the universal now ticking forward, the river you're floating in. That river is a cognitive construction, a feature of what it's like to be an information processing system embedded in an entropy gradient.

It's your brain's way of organizing its experience of correlations. It's extraordinarily useful. It might be the most useful cognitive fiction in the universe, but uh it's not fundamental reality. Fundamental reality is timeless, static, a mathematical structure containing everything that is and was and will be all at once in a quantum superposition of configurations that we read from the inside as history.

We are not beings who move through time. We are beings who contain the experience of time. And there is a profound difference. That's what the physics says.

And after 50 years of listening very carefully to what the physics says, I've learned to trust it. Even when, especially when it tells me something I find deeply uncomfortable, time doesn't exist. And somehow knowing that the moment I'm in right now feels more extraordinary than
