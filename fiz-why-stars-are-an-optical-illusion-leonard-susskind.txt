I'm going to tell you something that will completely change how you look at the night sky. Something that's both disturbing and profound. Something that most people don't fully appreciate even though they've heard it before. The stars you see in the sky are not real.

They're optical illusions, ghosts, images of things that don't exist anymore. At least not in the form you're seeing them. When you look up at the night sky, you are not seeing the present. You're seeing the past.

deep past, ancient past, and in many cases, you're seeing things that have already changed, moved, evolved, or even ceased to exist entirely by the time their light reaches your eyes. I'm Leonard Suskin, and I've spent my career thinking about spacetime, causality, and the structure of the universe. And I want to explain to you why the night sky is the greatest optical illusion in nature and why understanding this illusion reveals something profound about the nature of time itself. Let's start with the basics.

What do we mean when we say we're seeing the past? Light travels fast, really fast, about 300,000 km/s. That's fast enough to circle the Earth 7 and 12 times in 1 second. If you could travel at the speed of light, you could get from New York to Los Angeles in 1/60th of a second.

But space is big, incomprehensibly big. And even at 300,000 km/ second, light takes time to travel cosmic distances. The sun is about 150 million km away. That sounds far, but it's nothing on a cosmic scale.

Light from the sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. This means that when you look at the sun, and please don't actually look at the sun, it'll damage your eyes. You're not seeing the sun as it is right now. You're seeing the sun as it was 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago.

If the sun suddenly exploded, which it won't. It's far too stable. You wouldn't know about it for 8 minutes and 20 seconds. For those 8 minutes, the sun would look completely normal.

You'd have no warning. The explosion would be racing toward you at the speed of light, and you'd see it at exactly the moment the shock wave and radiation arrived. Now, 8 minutes isn't very long, but let's go further out. The nearest star to the sun is Proxima Centuri, part of the Alpha Centuri system.

It's about 4.2 light years away. Uh, a lightyear is the distance light travels in one year about 9.5 trillion km. So Proxima Centauri is about 40 trillion km away. When you look at Proxima Centauri, you're seeing light that left that star 4.2 years ago.

You're seeing the star as it was when that light departed. If something happened to that star today, if it flared or dimmed or was hit by a comet, you wouldn't know about it for 4.2 years. And here's the disturbing part. For all you know, Proxima Centtory doesn't exist anymore.

It could have exploded 3 years ago and the light from that explosion is still racing toward us through space. Right now, at this very moment, Proxima Centuri might be a cloud of expanding gas, but when you look at it tonight, you'll see a perfectly normal star. The star you see is a ghost, an image from the past. Now, let's talk about some of the bright stars you can see in the night sky, because this is where the time delays get really significant.

Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is about 8.6 light years away. When you look at Sirius, you're seeing it as it was 8.6 years ago. Vega, a bright blue white star in the summer sky, is about 25 light years away. You're seeing it as it was a quarter century ago.

Betalus, the uh red super giant in the constellation Orion, is about 640 light years away. When you look at Bettle Goose, you're seeing it as it was during the Renaissance, before Shakespeare was born, before Columbus sailed to the Americas. The light you're seeing left that star when Europe was in the late Middle Ages. And here's something that keeps astronomers up at night.

Beetlejuice is a super giant star approaching the end of its life. It could explode as a supernova at any time. And by any time, I mean it could have already exploded. The explosion could have happened 500 years ago and the light from that explosion is still on its way to us.

We wouldn't see it for another 140 years or it could explode tomorrow or a thousand years from now. We have no way of knowing until the light arrives. The battle juice you see in the sky is a 640year-old ghost. The real battle juice, the battle juice that exists now in some absolute sense is completely unknown to us.

We can't see it. We can't know what it's doing. The information hasn't reached us yet. Now, let's go even further.

Let's talk about objects you can see with the naked eye that are even more distant. On a dark night away from city lights, you can see a faint fuzzy patch in the constellation Andromeda. That's the Andromeda galaxy, a spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way containing about a trillion stars. Andromeda is 2.5 million lighty years away.

When you look at Andromeda, you're seeing light that left that galaxy 2.5 million years ago, long before humans existed, before homo sapiens, before homo erectus, when our ancestors were oropithesines, barely distinguishable from other apes walking around East Africa. The Andromeda you see is an image from when mastadons and saber-tooth cats roam the earth. And with a telescope, you can see even further into the past. The Hubble Space Telescope has taken images of galaxies so distant that the light has been traveling for over 13 billion years.

These galaxies are seen as they were when the universe was less than a billion years old. Before the Earth existed, before the sun existed, before most of the stars in our galaxy existed, we're not just looking far away in space. We're looking far back in time. The universe is a time machine.

The farther you look, the further into the past you see. Now, here's where this gets philosophically disturbing. Let me ask you a question. What does it mean for something to exist now?

In everyday life, we have a very clear sense of now. Right now, as you're listening to this, there are things happening all over the world. People are eating breakfast in Tokyo. The sun is setting in London.

Waves are crashing on beaches in Australia. All of this is happening now simultaneously at the same moment. But is it really? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, which has been confirmed by countless experiments over the past century, there is no universal now.

Simultaneity is relative. Different observers moving at different velocities will disagree about which events are simultaneous. If you're standing still and I'm moving past you at high speed, events that you consider simultaneous happening at the same time, I will not consider simultaneous. My now is different from your now.

This is not a matter of perception or measurement error. This is fundamental to the structure of spaceime. There is no absolute present moment that extends across the entire universe. So when I ask what is Betal Juice doing right now that question doesn't have a well- definfined answer.

There is no universal right now that includes both Earth and Betal Juice. My now and BetJu now are not synchronized. They can't be synchronized. Different observers will disagree about what is happening at Betal Goose now.

An observer moving toward Betal Goose at high speed will see a different now at Betal Goose than an observer moving away from it. So when you look at Betal Juice and you see it as it was 640 years ago, you might think, well, that's the past. There's also a present version of Betal Goose the way it is right now that I just can't see yet. But that's not quite right.

There is no unique right now for Betal Goose. The concept of simultaneity breaks down over cosmic distances. All you have is what you can observe the light reaching you from the past. In a very real sense, the past light cone is all that exists for you.

Everything outside your past light cone, everything that's too far away for light to have reached you yet, uh, is not part of your observable reality. It's not in your now. It might as well not exist as far as you can determine. Let me make this more concrete with a spac-time diagram.

Imagine a graph with time going up the vertical axis and space going horizontally. Your position in space time is a point on this diagram. And as time progresses, you trace out a vertical line, your world line. Now draw two diagonal lines from your current position.

One going down and to the left, one going down and to the right. Both at 45°. These represent the paths of light rays coming toward you from opposite directions. They define your past light cone, the region of spaceime from which light could have reached you by now.

Everything inside that cone is part of your observable universe. Every star you see, every galaxy, every cosmic event you can detect, it's all inside that past light cone. But there's an enormous amount of spaceime outside that cone. events that are too far away, too recent for their light to have reached you yet.

Those events are in your elsewhere. They're space-like, separated from you. They're not in your past. They're not in your future.

They're in a region of spaceime that is causally disconnected from you at this moment. Belgus, as it exists right now, whatever that means, is in your elsewhere. You cannot see it. You cannot interact with it.

You cannot know anything about it. All you can see is the 640year-old image inside your past light cone. The stars you see in the sky are not images of things that exist now. They're images of events in your past light cone.

They're fossils. Frozen moments from the history of the universe, trapped in photons that have been traveling through space for years, centuries, or millennia. Now, let me tell you about something even stranger. The stars you see don't even exist at the locations where you see them.

This sounds crazy, but it's absolutely true. Let me explain. When you look at a star, you see it in a particular direction. You point to it in the sky.

You say, "That's Beetle over there in Orion." But Beetle Goose isn't actually over there anymore. Beetle Goose is moving. All stars are moving. The galaxy is rotating.

Stars have their own peculiar velocities. Over 640 years, Betal Goose has moved from where it was when the light you're seeing left. Now, Betal Goose is moving relatively slowly, only about 30 km/s relative to us. Over 640 years, that's a total displacement of about 600 billion km or about 0.03 light years.

That's a pretty small angular shift. Hard to notice without precise measurements. But for stars moving at higher velocities or at greater distances, the effect is much larger. The star you see in one location might have moved significantly by now, whatever now means.

And for distant galaxies, the effect is dramatic. Galaxies can have velocities of thousands of kilometers/s. The Andromeda galaxy, for instance, is moving toward us at about 110 km/s. Over the 2.5 million years it took its light to reach us, Andromeda has moved about 8,000 lighty years closer.

So, the Andromeda you see is not where Andromeda is now. It's where Andromeda was 2.5 million years ago. And because of the expansion of the universe for very distant galaxies, the situation is even more extreme. Galaxies billions of light years away are receding from us due to the expansion of space itself.

The farther away they are, the faster they're receding. Some of these galaxies are receding faster than the speed of light, not through space, but because space itself is expanding. The galaxy you see billions of light years away is now much farther away than it was when the light left. The distance between us has increased while the light was in transit.

So, not only are you seeing the past, you're seeing objects at locations where they no longer are. The night sky is a map of where things were, not where things are. The illusion is complete. The stars you see are ghosts at phantom locations from ancient times.

Now, let me tell you why this matters. Why this is not just a curiosity but something fundamental about the nature of reality. The fact that we can only see the past or we can only access information from our past light cone places fundamental limits on what we can know about the universe. We cannot see the entire universe.

We can only see the observable universe. The part of the universe from which light has had time to reach us since the big bang. The observable universe is a sphere about 93 billion lightyears across centered on us. But that's not the whole universe.

The universe could be probably is much larger, maybe infinite. But we can't see beyond our cosmic horizon. Events happening beyond that horizon are forever inaccessible to us. Their light will never reach us because the expansion of space is carrying them away faster than their light can travel toward us.

This is a fundamental limit, not a technological limit. A limit imposed by the structure of spaceime itself. No matter how powerful our telescopes become, we will never see beyond our cosmic light cone. And there's something even more disturbing.

Because of the accelerating expansion of the universe driven by dark energy, the observable universe is actually shrinking in a certain sense. Galaxies that we can see now will eventually recede beyond our cosmic horizon and disappear from view. Not because they've stopped existing, but because space is expanding faster than light can travel. In the far future, trillions of years from now, most of the galaxies we see today will have receded beyond the cosmic horizon.

Future civilizations will look up at a much emptier sky than we see. They might not even know that uh other galaxies exist. All the evidence will have disappeared beyond the horizon. The night sky they see will be an even more impoverished ghost of reality than ours is.

Let me connect this back to something I've worked on extensively. Black holes and information. Near a black hole, time dilation becomes extreme. If you watch someone fall toward a black hole from far away, you see them slow down.

They approach the event horizon asmtoically, never quite crossing it from your perspective. Their image becomes redder and dimmer as time dilation increases until eventually they fade from view. But from their own perspective, they cross the horizon smoothly and fall into the black hole. Nothing special happens at the horizon from their point of view.

Two different observers see completely different realities and both are correct. Reality is observer dependent. The same thing happens with the night sky. Different observers see different versions of the stars.

An observer moving at high speed relative to Earth will see the stars in different locations with different colors due to Doppler shifts at different moments in their histories due to relativity of simultaneity. What you see when you look at the stars is not objective reality. It's your light cone. Your personal observer dependent slice of spaceime.

Another observer has a different slice, a different light cone, a different version of the sky. Now, you might ask, is any of this real? If what we see is always the past, always an illusion? Is there any objective reality out there?

And my answer is yes, but it's not what you think it is. Reality is not the three-dimensional space filled with stars that you perceive when you look up at night. Reality is the four-dimensional space-time structure, the full history of the universe, past, present, and future, all existing together as a single unchanging block. What you see, your personal light cone, your view of the sky is a cross-section of that fourdimensional reality.

It's real, but it's not complete. It's like taking a two-dimensional slice through a three-dimensional object. Uh the slice is real, but it doesn't show you the whole object. The stars in the sky are real events in spaceime.

They really happened. The photons really traveled from there to here. What you see is a genuine recording of ancient cosmic history. But the stars as they exist now outside your light cone in the elsewhere region of spacetime, those you cannot see.

Those are not part of your observable reality. And in a very real sense, they don't exist for you until their light reaches you. Let me give you one more example that really drives this home. Supernovi.

A supernova is the explosive death of a star. It's one of the most energetic events in the universe. For a few weeks, a single dying star can outshine an entire galaxy. Supernova 1,987a, visible from the southern hemisphere, was observed in 1987.

It occurred in the large melanic cloud, a small galaxy about 168,000 lighty years away. When astronomers saw the supernova in 1987, they were seeing an event that happened 168,000 years ago. The star exploded during the ice age when Neanderthals still roamed Europe. For those 168,000 years, the light from the explosion was racing through space toward Earth.

The event had already happened. The star was already dead, the shock wave already expanding, the remnant already cooling. But we didn't know about it. We couldn't know about it.

The information was still in transit. From our perspective, from inside our light cone, the supernova didn't exist until 1987 when the light arrived. Before that, it was in our elsewhere. It might as well not have happened as far as we were concerned.

But it did happen 168,000 years earlier. The event was real. The space-time coordinates of that explosion are fixed. The event exists in the space-time block, but it only entered our light cone, our observable reality in 1987.

This is the nature of cosmic observation. We're always looking at the past. We're always seeing ghosts. We're always working with information that's thousands, millions, billions of years out of date.

And there's no way around it. It's built into the structure of spaceime. Light has a finite speed and space is vast. And the combination means we can only ever see the past.

You know, when I was younger, first learning about light travel time and light cones and the relativity of simultaneity, I found this deeply unsettling. It bothered me that we can't know what's happening now or distant locations. It seemed like a fundamental limitation, a frustrating barrier to knowledge. But uh over the years, I've come to see it differently.

The fact that the night sky is a window into the past is not a limitation. It's a gift. Because the universe has a finite age, about 13.8 billion years, and a finite speed of light, we can actually see the history of the universe. By looking at different distances, we're looking at different times.

By looking farther and farther out, we can trace the evolution of galaxies, the formation of stars, the development of large-scale structure, all the way back to the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang itself. If light traveled infinitely fast, we'd only see the present. We'd have no direct access to cosmic history. We'd have to infer everything about the past from present conditions.

But because light travels at a finite speed, the universe is a cosmic archive. The evidence of the past is literally shining down on us from every direction. The night sky is a history book written in light. Every photon that enters your eye is a messenger from the past, a tiny packet of information carrying news of events long ago and far away.

When you look at the stars, you're receiving those messages. You're reading that history. The stars are optical illusions. They're not real in the sense of showing you the present state of the universe, but they're real in a deeper sense.

They're real events in spaceime, real data points in the cosmic history, real windows into the structure and evolution of the universe. And understanding this, really understanding that you're looking into the past every time you look up, changes how you think about the night sky. It's not just pretty lights in the darkness. It's ancient light carrying ancient information connecting you to the deep history of the cosmos.

The next time you look at the stars, remember you're seeing ghosts, phantoms from the past, optical illusions created by the finite speed of light and the vast distances of space. But those ghosts are real. They're evidence of the universe as it was, frozen in photons, racing through space for centuries or millennia or eons before reaching your eyes. The stars you see are not the stars that exist.

But the stars you see are the only stars you can ever know. And that is one of the most profound and beautiful facts about the universe. Thank you for listening. The stars are illusions, but they're the most truthful illusions in nature.
