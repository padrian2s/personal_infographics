Look up at the moon tonight. Go ahead. I'll wait. If it's nighttime where you are and the sky is clear, step outside and look at the moon.

You're seeing something that doesn't exist. Not in the form you're seeing it anyway. You're seeing a ghost, a phantom, a mirage. Now, before you think I've completely lost my mind, let me be very precise about what I mean.

The moon you see is not the moon as it exists right now. It's the moon as it existed 1.3 seconds ago. You are literally physically looking into the past every single time you look at the moon. I'm Leonard Suskin and I've spent my career thinking about the nature of time, observation, and reality.

And uh I want to convince you that even something as familiar, as close, as constantly present as the moon is fundamentally different from what you think it is. Let's start with the basics. How far away is the moon? The average distance from the Earth to the moon is about 384,400 km, roughly 239,000 mi.

That sounds far and it is compared to anything in our everyday experience. You could fit uh about 30 earths in a line between here and the moon. But on a cosmic scale, the moon is astonishingly close. It's our nearest celestial neighbor, the closest thing to us in the entire universe beyond our own planet.

Light travels at about 300,000 kilometers/s. At that speed, light from the moon takes approximately 1.28 seconds to reach Earth. We usually round this to 1.3 seconds. Now, 1.3 seconds doesn't sound like much.

And compared to the 8 minutes it takes light to travel from the sun or the four 2 years it takes from the nearest star, 1.3 seconds is trivial. Barely worth mentioning. But here's the thing. It's not zero.

And the fact that it's not zero has profound implications for what you're actually seeing when you look at the moon. When you look at the moon, you are not seeing the moon as it is right now. Whatever right now means. And we'll come back to that.

You are seeing photons that left the moon surface 1.3 seconds ago. Those photons have been traveling through the vacuum of space at the speed of light and they've just arrived at your eye. The image you're seeing is historical data. It's old information.

It's the moon from the past. Now, you might say, "So, what? 1.3 seconds is nothing. The moon doesn't change significantly in 1.3 seconds.

It's close enough to real time that it doesn't matter." And in practical terms, you'd be right. The moon is geologically dead. It doesn't have volcanoes erupting or continents shifting. Its surface doesn't change on time scales of seconds.

So the moon you see from 1.3 seconds ago looks identical to the moon as it exists right now. But that's not the point. The point is about the fundamental nature of observation and reality. Let me give you an example from the Apollo program because this is where the 1 3 second delay became very noticeable.

During the Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when astronauts walked on the moon, people watching on television noticed something odd. When mission control in Houston would ask the astronauts a question, there would be a pause, a delay before the astronaut responded. Some people thought the astronauts were being slow or or hesitant, but it wasn't that at all. It was light travel time.

When mission control asked a question, that question was sent as a radio signal which travels at the speed of light to the moon. That took 1.3 seconds. The astronaut heard the question, thought for a moment, and responded. The response traveled back to Earth at the speed of light, another 1.3 seconds.

The total roundtrip time was 2.6 seconds. So even if the astronaut responded instantly, which humans can't do, but even if they could, there would still be a two six second delay between the question leaving Houston and the answer arriving back in Houston. This is light travel time. This is the finite speed of information.

And it's completely unavoidable. You cannot get information from the moon to the earth faster than 1.3 seconds. period. It's a fundamental limit imposed by the structure of spacetime.

And that means that everything you see, everything you observe, everything you know about the moon is at least 1.3 seconds out of date. Now, let me make this even more interesting. Let's talk about what simultaneity means, or more precisely, what it doesn't mean. In Newtonian physics, before Einstein, everyone believed in absolute time.

If something happened on the moon at precisely noon and something happened on Earth at precisely noon, those two events were simultaneous. They happened at the same moment in an absolute sense that everyone in the universe would agree on. Einstein showed that this picture is wrong. Simultaneity is relative.

Different observers moving at different velocities will disagree about whether two events are simultaneous. Now, for observers on Earth who are all moving at roughly the same velocity, not moving at relativistic speeds relative to each other, we all agree pretty closely on what simultaneous means. The differences are tiny. But here's the key point.

There is no physical mechanism that synchronizes now on the moon with now on the Earth. There's no universal clock. There's no cosmic time coordinate that says this moment on Earth corresponds to this moment on the moon. Any synchronization we set up is arbitrary.

We can use light signals. We can use Einstein synchronization. We can use whatever convention we want. But it's a choice, not a fundamental fact about the universe.

So when I ask what is happening on the moon right now, that question doesn't have a well-defined answer. that's independent of the reference frame I'm using to define right now. Different observers moving at different velocities will have different surfaces of simultaneity. They'll disagree about which moment on the moon corresponds to right now on Earth.

For observers moving at ordinary velocities, walking speed, airplane speed, even satellite speed, these differences are incredibly small, micros secondsonds or less. But they're real. They're there. Simultaneity is not absolute.

And this means that the concept of the moon as it exists right now is not as clear-cut as you might think. It depends on your reference frame. It depends on how you choose to slice spaceime into space and time. Now, let me talk about something that might seem unrelated but is actually deeply connected.

Quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, observation is not a passive act. You can't observe a system without disturbing it. The act of measurement changes the state of the system.

For macroscopic objects like the moon, these quantum effects are incredibly small, far too small to measure with any conceivable technology. The moon is not in a quantum superp position of different positions. It's not both over here and over there until we look at it. The moon is classical.

It has a definite position or close enough that the quantum uncertainties are completely negligible. But here's the thing. Even for a classical object, observation takes time. And during that time, the object can change.

When you observe the moon, when photons from the moon enter your eye and strike your retina, those photons left the moon 1.3 seconds ago. During those 1.3 seconds, the moon has moved. How much has it moved? Let's calculate.

The moon orbits the earth with a period of about 27.3 days. Its orbital velocity is about 1 kilometer/s. In 1.3 seconds, the moon moves about 1.3 km. That's almost a mile.

So the moon you see is not at the location where the moon actually is right now. It's at the location where the moon was 1.3 seconds ago. The moon has moved 1.3 km since those photons left its surface. Now 1.3 km is a tiny distance compared to the moon size.

The moon is about 3,474 km in diameter. So the displacement is only about 0.04% of the moon's diameter. You can't see that difference without precise measurements. But it's real.

It's there. The moon, you see, is displaced from the moon as it exists right now. And here's where it gets philosophically interesting. If you wanted to point exactly at the moon, not at where it was 1.3 seconds ago, but at where it is right now, you'd have to aim ahead of where you see it.

You'd have to calculate its orbital motion, figure out how much it's moved in the past 1.3 seconds, and point to that location. But you can't see that location. You can't observe it directly. All you can observe is the past.

The light from the moon's current position hasn't reached you yet. It's still in transit. It won't arrive for another 1.3 seconds. The moon's current position is outside your past light cone.

It's in the elsewhere region of spaceime, space-like, separated from you at this moment. You cannot interact with it. You cannot observe it. You cannot know anything about it except by extrapolation and calculation.

All you can observe is the moon from 1.3 seconds ago. Now, let me tell you about one of the most precise measurements ever made in science. It involves the moon, and it illustrates just how carefully we can track its motion despite the light travel time delay. In 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin placed a retroreflector on the moon's surface.

This is an array of mirrors arranged in such a way that any light hitting it is reflected directly back toward the source. Since then, astronomers have been shining laser beams from Earth to these retroreflectors. The laser light travels to the moon, bounces off the retroreflector, and travels back to Earth. By measuring the total round trip time, which is about two, six seconds, astronomers can calculate the distance to the moon with incredible precision.

How precise? To within a few millimeters. That's right. We can measure the distance to the moon, which is about 384,400 km to an accuracy of a few millimeters.

That's one part in 100 billion. It's an extraordinary achievement. And this measurement is done continuously. We've been bouncing lasers off the moon for over 50 years now.

And we've discovered something fascinating. The moon is moving away from Earth. Not quickly. Only about 3.8 cm per year.

But it's real and it's measurable. Over hundreds of millions of years, the moon has been slowly receding from Earth due to tidal interactions. Now, here's what's relevant for our discussion. When we do this laser ranging experiment, we have to account for light travel time.

The laser pulse we send doesn't hit the moon where the moon is when we send it. It hits the moon where the moon will be 1.3 seconds later after the light has traveled there. Similarly, the reflected light doesn't come back from where the moon is when it reflects. It comes back from where the moon was when it reflected the light, which is 1.3 seconds before it reaches us.

So the entire experiment is an elaborate dance of accounting for light travel time. We're always looking at where the moon was, not where it is. And to calculate the distance correctly, we have to account for the moon's motion during the light travel time. This is not a subtle effect.

This is a central part of the calculation. Without accounting for light travel time, the measurements would be wrong. Now, let me address something that might seem like a tangent, but is actually central to understanding why the moon is a mirage. The moon is tidily locked to the earth.

This means that the same side of the moon always faces the earth. The moon rotates on its axis at exactly the same rate that it orbits the earth. So, one lunar day equals one lunar month. About 27.3 Earth days.

Why is this? It's because of tidal forces. The Earth's gravitational pull is stronger on the near side of the moon than on the far side. This creates a tidal bulge.

The moon is slightly elongated in the direction of the Earth. Early in the moon's history, it was rotating faster than it is now. But the tidal bulge wasn't aligned with the Earth Moon line because the moon was rotating. The Earth's gravity pulled on this misaligned bulge, creating a torque that slowed down the moon's rotation over millions of years.

This torque slowed the moon's rotation until it became synchronized with its orbital period. Now, the tidal bulge is always aligned with the Earth moon line, and there's no more torque. The moon is locked in place. This tidal locking is stable.

The same side of the moon always faces Earth, and it always will, barring some catastrophic event. But here's the thing. Because the moon is tidily locked, we only ever see one side of it. The far side of the moon, sometimes mistakenly called the dark side, though it gets just as much sunlight as the near side, is forever hidden from our view from Earth.

Until humans sent spacecraft around the moon in the late 1950s and 1960s, no one had ever seen the far side. It was completely unknown. And even now in the age of satellites and lunar orbiters, you cannot see the far side of the moon from Earth. It's geometrically impossible.

So when you look at the moon, you're not just seeing a ghost from 1.3 seconds ago. You're also only seeing half of the object. The other half is permanently hidden. The moon you observe is not the full moon.

It's a partial view limited by geometry and title locking. Now, let me connect all of this back to something fundamental about the nature of reality and observation. Everything I've said about the moon applies to everything you observe. Every single thing.

When you look at another person across the room, you're not seeing them as they exist right now. You're seeing them as they existed a few nanoseconds ago. The time it took light to travel from them to you. The difference is so small, a few billionth of a second, that it's completely negligible for any practical purpose.

But it's real. When you look at the sun, you see it as it was 8 minutes ago. When you look at the nearest star, you see it as it was 4 years ago. When you look at a distant galaxy, you see it as it was millions or billions of years ago.

There is no instantaneous observation. There is no way to see something as it is right now in an absolute sense. All observation is historical. All observation involves light travel time.

All observation is limited by the finite speed of light. And this is not a limitation of our technology or our measurement capabilities. This is a fundamental feature of the universe. It's built into the structure of spaceime itself.

The speed of light is not just the speed at which light travels. It's the speed at which causality propagates. It's the maximum speed at which information can travel from one point in space to another. And because information can only travel at a finite speed, there is always a delay between when something happens and when we can observe it happening.

This delay is tiny for nearby objects, nanoseconds for things in the same room, milliseconds for things on the other side of the earth. But it's always there. For the moon, the delay is 1.3 seconds. Long enough to be noticeable in radio communications.

Long enough to require precise calculations and laser ranging experiments. Long enough to matter. The moon you see is not the moon as it exists. It's an image, a reconstruction, a historical record encoded in photons and projected onto your retina.

It's a mirage. Now, you might object. You might say, "But Lenny, if I can predict where the moon will be 1.3 seconds from now based on its orbit, then I can know where the moon is right now, even though I can't see it yet. So, it's not really a mystery." And you'd be right for the moon.

We can predict its position very accurately. We know its orbit. We know its velocity. We can calculate where it is right now, even though we're seeing where it was 1.3 seconds ago.

But that's prediction, not observation. It's inference based on past data, not direct knowledge of the present. And for many objects in the universe, we can't make such predictions. Supernova explosions are unpredictable.

Asteroids can change course. Distant galaxies evolve in complex ways. For those objects, the past is all we have. We can see what they were.

We cannot see what they are. And even for the moon where we can predict its current position, there's always some uncertainty, some chance of an unpredicted event, a meteor impact, a piece of equipment left by Apollo missions, uh, falling over, something direct observation, seeing the moon as it exists right now is impossible, forever impossible, not because of technological limitations, but because of the structure of spaceime. Let me end with a thought experiment that I think really captures the stranges of all this. Imagine you could somehow send a signal to the moon that travels faster than light.

Impossible, yes. But humor me for a moment. You send this faster than light signal at the same time you look at the moon. The signal arrives at the moon instantly, faster than the light you're seeing, which left 1.3 seconds earlier.

The moon receives your signal. something changes on the moon in response to your signal, but you won't see that change for 1.3 seconds because the light from the change has to travel back to you at the speed of light. So, you'd be in this strange situation where you know because you sent the signal that the moon has changed, but uh you can't see it yet. You're still seeing the old moon from before you sent the signal.

The moon you observe would be inconsistent with the moon as it actually is. The observation would be out of sync with reality. This is why faster than light communication is impossible. It would create causality violations paradoxes.

It would allow you to observe effects before their causes. The universe doesn't allow this. The speed of light is the speed of causality and it's absolute. And this means that observation is always historical, always delayed, always limited by light travel time.

The moon you see is a ghost from 1.3 seconds ago. And it will always be a ghost. There is no way to see the moon as it exists right now. The present moon is forever beyond your observational horizon.

That's not a limitation of our eyes or our telescopes. That's a feature of the universe. The moon is a mirage. Not in the sense of being an illusion or not existing.

The moon is real. The photons you see are real. The image is real. But what you see is not what exists.

What you see is what existed 1.3 seconds ago. And that gap, that unavoidable delay between event and observation is one of the most profound facts about the nature of reality. You know, when I first really understood this, when I first appreciated that every observation involves looking into the past, it changed how I think about the universe. We like to imagine that we live in a shared present moment, that there's a now that extends across all of space and we're all experiencing it together.

But that's not how the universe works. There is no shared present moment. There are only light cones, regions of spacetime that can causally interact with each other. The moon 1.3 seconds ago is in your past light cone.

You can see it. You can know about it. The moon right now is in your elsewhere. You cannot see it.

You cannot know about it except by prediction and extrapolation. And this is true for everything. For every star, every galaxy, every particle in the universe, all observation is historical. All knowledge is delayed.

All information propagates at the speed of light. No faster. The next time you look at the moon, remember you're seeing a ghost, an echo, a message from the past, frozen in photons, racing across space at the ultimate speed limit of the universe. The moon is a mirage and so is everything else you've ever seen.

Thank you for listening. Look up at the moon tonight.
