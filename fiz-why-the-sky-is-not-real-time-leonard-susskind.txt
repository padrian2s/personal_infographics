I'm going to tell you something that will fundamentally change how you experience the world around you. Something so basic, so pervasive that once you understand it, you'll never look at reality the same way again. Nothing you see is happening right now. Not the stars, not the moon, not the Sunday, not even the sky itself.

Everything you observe, every single thing is a delayed recording, a historical playback, an echo from the past. And when I say past, I don't just mean the distant past of stars thousands of light years away. I mean everything. The clouds above you, the birds flying overhead, the airplane in the distance, even the blue of the daytime sky itself.

All of it is in the past. All of it takes time to reach your eyes. And during that time measured in nanconds, micros seconds or seconds depending on distance, reality has moved on. I'm Leonard Suskin and I've spent my career thinking about time, causality, and the fundamental limits on what we can know about the universe.

And I want to convince you that the sky, the entire visual experience of looking up, is not a real-time phenomenon. It's a carefully orchestrated illusion delayed and distorted by the finite speed of light than the atmosphere we live in. Let's start with something basic that most people don't think about. The speed of light in air.

Everyone knows that light travels at about 300,000 km/s in a vacuum. That's the cosmic speed limit, the fastest that anything, including information, can travel through space. But we don't live in a vacuum. We live at the bottom of an ocean of air, a sea of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor that extends about 100 km above the surface of the Earth.

And light travels slower in air than it does in a vacuum. Not much slower. The difference is small, but it's real. It's measurable.

And it has profound implications. The refractive index of air at sea level at standard temperature and pressure is about 1.003. What does that mean? It means that light travels in air at about 0.9997 times the speed it travels in a vacuum.

Let me put a number on that. In a vacuum, light travels at 299,792,458 m/s. In air, it travels at about 299,72,547 m/s. The difference is about 90,000 m/s.

Roughly 90 km/s. Now, 90 km/s still sounds incredibly fast, and it is. But the fact that it's not infinite, the fact that it's not instantaneous, means that there's a delay, a lag, a time between when something happens and when you see it happen. For nearby objects, things in the same room as you, this delay is utterly negligible.

Light from an object 1 meter away takes about 3.3 nanconds to reach your eye. 3 billionth of a second. You could never notice that delay. It's far, far shorter than the processing time of your retina and brain.

But as we look at more distant objects, things farther away in the sky, the delays start to add up. Let's do some calculations. Let's figure out exactly how delayed your view of the sky actually is. Consider a bird flying overhead at an altitude of say 100 m.

Light from that bird takes about 330 nonds to reach your eye. still completely negligible for any practical purpose. You can't perceive that delay. Now consider a commercial airplane flying at cruise altitude about 10,000 m or 10 km.

Light from that airplane takes about 33 microsconds 33 millionth of a second to reach you. Still short, but now we're getting into time scales where things start to matter. In 33 microsconds, an airplane traveling at 900 km/h moves about 8 mm. Not much, but measurable if you had precise enough instruments.

What about clouds? A typical cloud might be at an altitude of 2,000 to 6,000 m. Light from a cloud at 5,000 m takes about 17 micros secondsonds to reach your eye. During that time, if the cloud is moving at say 20 kilometers per hour in the wind, it moves about 0.1 millimeters.

Tiny but real. Now, let's go further. Let's look at the horizon. Uh the horizon, the farthest point you can see on Earth's surface is about 5 km away.

If you're standing at sea level, light from the horizon takes about uh 17 microsconds to reach you. But wait, it's more complicated than that. Because light traveling from the horizon to you doesn't travel in a straight line. It travels through air that varies in density.

The air near the ground is denser than the air higher up. And as light passes through these layers of different density, it bends. It refracts. This is atmospheric refraction.

And it's one of the most important and least appreciated phenomena in everyday observation. Let me explain how atmospheric refraction works because it's absolutely central to why the sky is not real time. Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium. But when light passes from one medium to another, from air to water or from less dense air to more dense air, it bends.

This bending is called refraction. And it happens because light travels at different speeds in media of different densities. When light enters a denser medium, it slows down. And when it slows down, it changes direction.

It bends toward the normal, the perpendicular to the surface. In Earth's atmosphere, the density of air decreases with altitude. Air at sea level is denser than air at 1,000 m, which is denser than air at 10,000 m. So, light traveling downward through the atmosphere is constantly moving from less dense air to more dense air.

And this means it's constantly bending downward toward the Earth. The result is that light from objects near the horizon follows a curved path through the atmosphere. The light doesn't travel in a straight line from the object to your eye. It curves.

It arcs. It follows the curvature of the atmosphere. And this has several extraordinary consequences. First, it means that objects near the horizon appear higher in the sky than they actually are.

The light is bent downward as it travels through the atmosphere, so it reaches your eye at an angle that's higher than the geometric straight line angle would be. For an object on the horizon, this effect is substantial. Atmospheric refraction can make an object appear about 0.6° higher than it actually is. That might not sound like much, but 0.6° 6° is larger than the angular diameter of the sun or moon, both of which are about 0.5° across.

This means, and this is one of the most remarkable facts about uh everyday observation, that when you see the sun touching the horizon at sunset, the sun is actually already below the horizon. Let me say that again because it's genuinely astonishing. When the bottom of the sun's disc appears to touch the horizon, the actual geometric true position of the sun is entirely below the horizon. You are seeing the sun in a position where if the atmosphere suddenly vanished, the sun would instantly disappear.

The sun you see at the horizon is a ghost, a mirage, an image created by atmospheric refraction showing you an object that is not where it appears to be. And the same thing happens at sunrise. When you see the top of the sun appear at the horizon, the sun hasn't actually reached the horizon yet. It's still below.

The light you're seeing has been bent by the atmosphere, allowing you to see the sun a few minutes early. The practical effect is that atmospheric refraction extends the day. Sunrise happens about 2 minutes earlier than it would without an atmosphere. Sunset happens about 2 minutes later.

We get about four extra minutes of daylight every day because of atmospheric refraction. 4 minutes doesn't sound like much, but over the course of a year, atmospheric refraction gives us about 24 extra hours of daylight. A full extra day of light purely from the bending of sunlight through the atmosphere. Now, let's talk about another atmospheric effect that delays light and distorts what you see.

The ionosphere. The ionosphere is a layer of the atmosphere that extends from about 50 km to over 1,000 km in altitude. It's called the ionosphere because the atoms in this region are ionized, stripped of electrons by high energy ultraviolet radiation from the sunday. When light or more generally electromagnetic radiation passes through the ionosphere, it interacts with these free electrons and these interactions slow down the light.

They introduce a delay. The amount of delay depends on the frequency of the radiation and on the density of free electrons in the ionosphere, something we call the total electron content or TEC. For visible light, the ionospheric delay is utterly negligible. We're talking nanconds at most.

But for lower frequency radiation radio waves, for instance, the delay can be substantial. This is a huge problem for GPS. Global positioning system satellites transmit radio signals at frequencies around 1.5 GHz. These signals pass through the ionosphere on their way to GPS receivers on the ground.

And the ionosphere introduces a delay, a slowing down of the signals that can be tens of meters in terms of apparent distance. If we didn't correct for ionospheric delay, GPS would be wildly inaccurate. Your GPS navigation would tell you that you're tens of meters away from where you actually are. For driving directions, that might not matter much, but for precision applications, surveying, aviation, military targeting, it's completely unacceptable.

So, GPS receivers use clever tricks to correct for ionospheric delay. Modern GPS satellites transmit on multiple frequencies. And because the ionosphere is a dispersive medium, different frequencies are delayed by different amounts. You can compare the signals at different frequencies and calculate the ionospheric delay then correct for it.

But uh here's what's relevant for our discussion. Even for something as simple as looking up at the sky, the light has to pass through the ionosphere and the ionosphere introduces a delay. Not a large delay for visible light, far smaller than the delays from light travel time through the lower atmosphere, but a real delay nonetheless. The sky you see has been filtered through multiple layers of atmosphere, each introducing its own delay and distortion.

Now, let me tell you about something even more fundamental. Something that applies not just to the sky, but to every single thing you observe. The act of observation requires light to travel from the object to your eye. And light travels at a finite speed.

Therefore, there is always always a delay between when something happens and when you see it happen. This is not a limitation of your eyes or your brain. This is a fundamental feature of the universe. Observation is not instantaneous.

It cannot be instantaneous. The speed of light is finite and nothing, not information, not causality, not anything can travel faster than light. For objects, nearby objects in the same room, the same building, the same city, the delays are so short that they're utterly negligible for any practical purpose. Nanc microsconds.

You can't perceive them. You can't measure them without uh extraordinarily precise instruments. And they don't affect your daily life in any way. But the delays exist.

They're real and they accumulate as you look at more distant objects. When you look at a mountain on the horizon, say 50 km away, light from that mountain takes about 170 micro seconds to reach you. During that time, if a rock falls off the mountain, you won't see it for 170 micro seconds after it happens. Uh when you look at the moon, the delay is 1.3 seconds.

The moon you see is the moon as it existed 1.3 seconds ago. When you look at the sun, the delay is 8 minutes and 20 seconds. The sun you see is the sun as it existed 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago. If the sun exploded right now, you wouldn't know about it for 8 minutes and 20 seconds.

When you look at the nearest star beyond the sun Proxima Centuri, the delay is 4.2 years. You're seeing Proxima Centuri as it was 4.2 years ago. And when you look at distant galaxies, the delay is measured in millions or billions of years. You're seeing those galaxies as they were in the deep past, long before humans existed, before the Earth existed, before the sun existed.

All of this is standard astronomy. Most people know that looking at distant objects means looking into the past. But what people don't appreciate, what I want to emphasize, is that this applies to everything. There is no special distance where observation suddenly becomes instantaneous.

There's no threshold beyond which delay starts and below which it doesn't exist. The delay is always there. Even for objects inches away from you, even for the air directly in front of your face. Light from an object 1 millimeter from your eye takes 3.3 picos seconds, 3 trillionth of a second to reach your retina.

That's unfathomably short. But it's not zero. It's not instantaneous. The universe does not allow instantaneous observation.

Observation is always historical, always delayed, always a playback of something that has already happened. Now, let me talk about something that really drives this home. What you see when you look up at the daytime sky, the blue sky, the scattered sunlight that makes the sky appear blue during the day is not coming from infinity. It's not coming from deep space.

It's coming from the atmosphere from air molecules at altitudes of a few kilome to a few dozen kilome. So how delayed is it? Consider light scattered from air molecules at an altitude of 10 km directly above you. That light has traveled from the sun to those air molecules 8 minutes and 20 seconds and then from those air molecules down to your eye about 33 micros secondsonds.

So the blue sky you see is light that left the sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago was scattered by air molecules 33 micro seconds ago and is just now reaching your eye. The blue of the sky is not real time. It's 8 minutes and 20 seconds out of date, plus 33 micros seconds. It's a delayed playback of sunlight that left the sun in the past, scattered off air molecules in the slightly more recent past, and is reaching you now as a historical record.

Every aspect of the sky, the blue, the clouds, the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, everything is delayed. Nothing is real time. Nothing is instantaneous. Nothing is now in the sense of happening at the same moment you observe it.

And here's where this connects to something deep about the nature of time and relativity. In Einstein's special relativity, there is no universal now. Simultaneity is relative. Different observers moving at different velocities will disagree about which events are simultaneous about which events are happening at the same time.

For observers moving at ordinary velocities, walking speed, car speed, even airplane speed, these differences are tiny, utterly negligible. Everyone on Earth agrees to extraordinary precision about what now means. But the point is that there's no absolute universal now that extends across space. Now is a choice, a convention, a coordinate system we impose on spacetime.

And because of this, the question, what is happening in the sky right now doesn't have a unique well- definfined answer that's independent of your reference frame. If you're standing still on Earth's surface, your surface of simultaneity, your now is one thing. If you're in an airplane moving at high speed, your now is slightly different. The events in the sky that you would call simultaneous with this moment are different from the events a stationary observer would call simultaneous.

The differences are tiny micros secondsonds or less for ordinary speeds, but they're real. Simultaneity is not absolute. And this means that the very concept of real time observation is suspect. What does real time mean?

It means seeing something as it happens right now. But right now is not well defined across spatial separations. There is no unique right now for events happening at different locations. All we have is what we can observe the light reaching us from the past.

The contents of our past light cone. And that fundamentally is always delayed, always historical, always a record of something that has already happened. The sky is not real time because real time doesn't exist. Not in the absolute sense.

Not in the sense of a universal present moment extending across space. Now, you might uh object. You might say, "Lenny, this is all technically true, but the delays are so small for most of what we see that they don't matter. The sky is close enough to real time that we can treat it as real time for all practical purposes.

And for most purposes, you'd be right. The delays for nearby objects are genuinely negligible. They don't affect your daily life. They don't affect your ability to navigate the world, to interact with objects, to function as a human being.

But here's why I think it's important to understand that these delays exist, even when they're small. First, because it changes how you think about observation in reality. Once you understand that nothing you see is actually happening now that all observation is delayed you start to appreciate the fundamental role that light travel time plays in structuring our experience of the universe. Second because in some contexts these delays do matter.

GPS corrections for atmospheric and ionospheric delay, astronomical observations that need to account for light travel time and atmospheric refraction, high precision measurements of distances and times. Third, because it connects to deep questions in physics about the nature of time, causality, and the structure of spaceime. And fourth, and this is the reason I find it most compelling, because it's true. The sky is not real time.

It's delayed. It's filtered. It's refracted. It's a carefully constructed playback of light from the past assembled by your brain into a coherent picture of the world.

And recognizing that, really understanding it gives you a deeper appreciation for how extraordinary vision is, how remarkable light is, and how strange the universe really is. Let me give you one more example that I think really captures the strangeness of all this. Imagine you're watching a lightning storm on the horizon 10 km away. You see a flash of lightning.

About 30 seconds later, you hear the thunder. The delay between the lightning and the thunder is easy to understand. Sound travels much slower than light, about 340 m/s versus 300,000 km/s. So, sound takes about 30 seconds to travel 10 km, while light takes only about 33 microsconds.

But uh here's what most people don't realize. The lightning you see is also delayed. Not by 30 seconds, by 33 micros secondsonds. The flash of lightning happened 33 micros seconds before you saw it.

During those 33 microsconds, the lightning bolt was already gone. The electrical discharge had already dissipated. The plasma had already started to cool. The lightning you see is a ghost, an image of something that no longer exists by the time you observe it.

The same is true for everything. Every visual observation is an observation of something that no longer exists in the form you're seeing it. The object has moved on. Time has passed.

Reality has changed. What you see is not what is. What you see is what was. The sky, the entire visual experience of looking up is a historical record, a playback, a mirage created by light that left the sun minutes ago or the moon seconds ago or distant stars years ago, filtered through an atmosphere that bends it and delays it and scatters it before it finally reaches your eye.

It's not real time. It never has been. It never could be. And that I think is one of the most profound and underappreciated facts about the nature of observation.

You know, when I first really understood this, when I first appreciated that every observation involves a delay, that real time observation is impossible, it changed how I think about the present moment. We tend to imagine that we live in a shared present, that there's a now that extends across all of space and we're all experiencing it together. that uh when I look up at the sky, I'm seeing the sky as it is right now in the same moment that someone on the other side of the world is seeing the sky as it is right now. But that's not how the universe works.

There is no shared present moment. There are only light cones, regions of spaceime that can causally interact. The sky I see is the intersection of my past light cone with the atmosphere. It's the set of events from which light could have reached me by now.

And that set is different for every observer. Every person has a slightly different past light cone, a slightly different view of the sky, a slightly different experience of what now means. The sky is personal, observer dependent, delayed, refracted, filtered through the physics of light and atmosphere and the geometry of spaceime. It's not real time.

And recognizing that, really understanding it changes how you see the world. The next time you look up at the sky, at the blue, at the clouds, at the sun or moon or stars, remember you're not seeing now. You're seeing then. A collection of thens from different moments in the past assembled into a single visual experience.

The sky is a time machine, a window into history, a carefully orchestrated illusion that feels immediate, but is actually a delayed playback of light from the past. And that to me is far more interesting than any simple notion of real time could ever be. Thank you for listening. The sky is not real time.

And now you understand
