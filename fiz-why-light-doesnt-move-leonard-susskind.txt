Let me ask you something. What do you think light is? Go ahead, take your best guess. You probably said something like light is energy that travels from one place to another.

Or maybe light is tiny particles flying through space really, really fast. Or maybe you're a little more sophisticated and you said light is an electromagnetic wave rippling through the vacuum. Here's the thing. Every single one of those answers is wrong.

or at least deeply fundamentally incomplete in ways that should keep you up at night if you think about them carefully enough. I'm Leonard Suskin and I have spent decades thinking about light. Decades. And I can tell you with complete honesty that light is one of the strangest things in the entire universe.

Stranger than black holes. Stranger than the big bang. stranger than quantum mechanics itself in some ways because light is the thing that connects all of those mysteries together. So, buckle up.

We're going to take apart everything you think you know about light piece by piece and put it back together in a way that's actually true. Let's start with the most basic misconception. Most people think light moves. They think it travels, that it goes from here to there, that it takes time to make the journey.

And on the surface that seems obviously correct. Light from the sun takes about 8 minutes to reach the earth. Light from distant stars takes years, even millions of years. So clearly light is moving, right?

Except from the perspective of the light itself, none of that is true. Not even a little bit. Here's what I mean. In Einstein special relativity, there's this concept called proper time.

Proper time is the time experienced by an object as it moves through spaceime. For you and me, proper time ticks away steadily. We age. We experience the passage of time.

We have memories of the past and anticipation of the future. Our proper time is real and measurable. Now, a photon, a single particle of light has zero proper time. Zero.

None. The photon that left the surface of the sun 8 minutes ago from its own perspective arrived at your eye at exactly the same moment it was emitted. No time passed. No journey occurred.

The emission and the absorption are from the photon's point of view the same event. Think about that for a second. You look up at the sun and the light hitting your face has been traveling for 8 minutes by your clock. But for that light there was no traveling.

There was no eight minutes. There was nothing in between. The sun and your eye are from the photons's perspective the same place at the same time. And it gets even more mind-bending than that.

The light from the Andromeda galaxy that's 2 and a half million light years away. It's been traveling through space for 2 and a half million years by our reckoning. But for that photon, for that single particle of light, no time has passed. None.

It's the same as if Andromeda were right next to us. From the photon's perspective, there is no distance either. The light doesn't experience space or time during its journey because there is no journey. Now, I know what you're thinking, Lenny, that's crazy.

How can something travel 2 and a half million light years and not experience any time? That doesn't make sense. And you're right, it doesn't make sense. Not to our intuitions anyway, but our intuitions evolved to deal with speeds much, much slower than light.

We evolved to navigate a world where things take time to get from here to there. The universe doesn't care about our intuitions. It does what the mathematics tells it to do. And the mathematics is absolutely clear on this point.

Photons don't experience time. This leads to a fascinating philosophical question. Does light actually move at all? In one sense, yes, we observe it.

We measure its speed. We know it takes finite time to cross distances as measured by our clocks. But in another sense, no. From the photon's own frame of reference, there is no motion, no passage of time, no journey.

It simply is existing at both end points simultaneously. This is not just some abstract philosophical puzzle. This is a direct consequence of Einstein's special relativity, one of the most thoroughly tested theories in all of physics. We've confirmed time dilation, the slowing of clocks for moving objects thousands upon thousands of times in particle accelerators, with GPS satellites, with cosmic ray measurements.

It's a fact of nature. Now, let's talk about something that confuses almost everyone. The speed of light. Everyone knows that light travels at uh about 300,000 kilometers per second.

That's the cosmic speed limit. Nothing can go faster. Einstein said so and he was right. Except, and this is where people get really confused, that's only true in a vacuum.

In a vacuum, light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s. That number is so important that we've actually defined the meter in terms of it. The meter is now officially defined as the distance light travels in 1 299,792,458th of a second. So in a very real sense, the speed of light defines our unit of length.

But when light enters a medium, water, glass, air, anything, it slows down dramatically in some cases. In water, light travels at about 75% of its vacuum speed. In glass, it can be even slower. In some exotic materials, physicists have slowed light down to a crawl, literally walking speed.

In 1999, a team at Harvard actually brought light to a near complete stop inside a cloud of ultra cold atoms, 17 m/s. You could outrun it on a bicycle. And here's the really weird part. In 2013, physicists actually stopped light completely.

They stored it inside a crystal for a full minute and then released it. Light frozen in place like a fly in amber. So, what's going on? How can light, the fastest thing in the universe, be stopped dead in its tracks?

The answer is that individual photons, the actual particles of light, never slow down. They always travel at C, the speed of light in a vacuum. What happens when light enters a medium is much more subtle and much more interesting than simple slowing down. When light enters say a piece of glass, the photons interact with the atoms in the glass.

They get absorbed by the electrons in those atoms and then almost instantaneously the atoms remit new photons. These new photons travel at C between atoms. But there's a tiny delay, a tiny pause between absorption and reission. And it's these tiny delays accumulated over billions of interactions that make light appear to slow down.

So the light isn't actually moving slower. The individual photons are still zipping along at 300,000 km/s between each atom. But the overall propagation of the light signal, the information being carried is slower because of all those little stops and starts. It's like driving on a highway with lots of traffic lights.

Your uh car might be going 100 kilometers per hour between each light, but your average speed over the whole trip is much lower because of all the stopping. The light is doing the same thing. It's not that it's moving slower, it's that it's being interrupted constantly. And this distinction matters enormously because it means that even when light is slowed down in a medium, nothing has actually violated the speed limit.

The photons are still traveling at sea between interactions. The cosmic speed limit is never broken. But here's where it gets really interesting and a little bit controversial. If light slows down in a medium, that means other particles can potentially go faster than light in that medium.

And when they do, something spectacular happens. It's called Cherankov radiation. And it's the optical equivalent of a sonic boom. You know what a sonic boom is, right?

When an airplane breaks the sound barrier, when it goes faster than the speed of sound in air, it creates a shock wave, a boom. Well, when a charged particle, usually an electron, travels through a medium faster than light, travels through that same medium, it creates a similar shock wave, but made of light. A cone of blue light radiating outward from the particles path. This isn't science fiction.

This is real observed physics. You can see cherancov radiation in nuclear reactors. That distinctive blue glow in the cooling water around the fuel rods. It's beautiful and it's deeply weird because you're watching something go faster than light.

Now, before you get too excited about building a faster than light spaceship, let me be very clear. Nothing in this scenario is actually exceeding the fundamental speed limit. The cosmic speed limit is C. The speed of light in a vacuum, not the speed of light in water.

The electrons producing Cherinkov radiation are going faster than light in water, but they're still going slower than light in a vacuum. The speed limit hasn't been broken. The universe is still consistent. But this raises a fascinating question.

Is there anything that could actually go faster than C, faster than light in a vacuum? Theoretically, some physicists have proposed the existence of hypothetical particles called tachons. Tachons would be particles that always travel faster than light. They couldn't slow down to the speed of light any more than we could speed up to it.

For tachons, the speed of light would be a lower bound rather than an upper bound. The mathematics of tachons is interesting but deeply problematic. If tachons exist, they would have imaginary mass and I mean that in the mathematical sense, not the colloquial sense, the square root of a negative number. And even more disturbing, tachons could potentially allow information to travel backward in time, which would violate causality in a very fundamental way.

Most physicists today regard tachons as a mathematical curiosity rather than a real physical entity. We've never observed one, and there are good theoretical reasons to think they don't exist. But the fact that the equations allow for them tells us something interesting about the structure of spaceime and the nature of the speed limit. Now let's talk about one of the deepest and most fundamental questions about light.

What exactly is it? You might think this is a simple question. Light is electromagnetic radiation. It's made up of photons.

It has both wave properties and particle properties. Wave particle duality. You've probably heard of it. It's one of those things that every physics student learns about.

But wave particle duality is actually a much deeper and stranger concept than most people realize. Let me walk you through why. In the 1600s, there was a famous debate about the nature of light. Isaac Newton argued that light was made up of tiny particles, corpusles he called them.

Christian Huygens argued that light was a wave propagating through some medium for about 200 years. Newton's particle picture one, light was particles. End of story. Then in the 1800s, a series of experiments, Young's double slit experiment being the most famous, showed conclusively that light behaves like a wave.

It interferes with itself. It defracts around obstacles. It does all the things waves do. So the scientific consensus shifted.

Light is a wave. But then in the early 1900s along came Albert Einstein and he turned everything upside down again. In 1905, the same year he published special relativity. Einstein explained the photoelectric effect.

The photoelectric effect is when you shine light on a metal surface and electrons pop off. Classical wave theory couldn't explain some of the details of this effect. Specifically, it couldn't explain why the energy of the ejected electrons depended on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity. If light were purely a wave, brighter light should produce higher energy electrons.

But it didn't. Only higher frequency light produced higher energy electrons regardless of brightness. Einstein's explanation was radical. Light comes in discrete packets of energy which he called quanta.

Each quantum has an energy proportional to its frequency. These quanta are what we now call photons. And this explanation perfectly accounted for the photoelectric effect. So now we had a problem.

Light behaved like a wave in some experiments and like a particle in others. How could it be both? The answer that quantum mechanics eventually gave us is both profound and deeply unsatisfying. Light is neither a wave nor a particle.

It's something else entirely. Something for which we don't have a good word in everyday language. It's a quantum object. And quantum objects don't behave like anything in our everyday experience.

When you set up an experiment that's sensitive to wave properties, like Young's double slit experiment, light behaves like a wave. When you set up an experiment that's sensitive to particle properties like the photoelectric effect, light behaves like a particle, the light doesn't choose which one to be. The experiment determines which aspect of its nature gets revealed. And here's the really mind-bending part.

If you do the double slit experiment with single photons, one photon at a time, you still get an interference pattern. one photon at a time and you still get waves interfering with each other. How can a single particle interfere with itself? The answer is that the photon doesn't go through one slit or the other.

In some sense, it goes through both. Its quantum state described by what we call the wave function passes through both slits simultaneously and interferes with itself on the other side. Only when you detect the photon on the screen does it collapse to a a definite position. This is one of the strangest facts in all of physics.

And after nearly 100 years of quantum mechanics, we still don't fully understand what it means. But it's been confirmed by experiment thousands of times. It's not a matter of interpretation. It's a fact.

Now, let me talk about something even stranger. something that Einstein himself called spooky action at a distance and something that has profound implications for how light and information can and cannot travel through the universe. It's called quantum entanglement and it's the weirdest thing in physics. Here's the basic idea.

You can create pairs of photons that are entangled linked together in a quantum mechanical way. When you create these pairs, their properties are correlated. If you measure the polarization of one photon and find its vertical, the other photon will always be horizontal, no matter how far apart they are. Now, here's the spooky part.

Before you measure either photon, neither one has a definite polarization. They're both in a superp position of vertical and horizontal. The polarization only becomes definite at the moment of measurement. And when it becomes definite for one photon, it instantly becomes definite for the other, even if the other photon is on the other side of the universe.

Einstein hated this. He thought it proved that quantum mechanics was incomplete, that there must be some hidden information, some pre-existing property that determines the outcome of the measurement before it happens. He called this idea local hidden variables. But in 1964, a physicist named John Bell showed that you could actually design experiments to test whether local hidden variables exist.

Bell devised a set of mathematical inequalities, bell inequalities, that any local hidden variable theory must satisfy. If quantum mechanics was right and the correlations were really instantaneous, the Bell inequalities would be violated. And when the experiments were done starting in the 1980s with Elaine Aspect's famous experiments and continuing right up to the present day, the Bell inequalities were violated every single time. Quantum mechanics was right.

Local hidden variables don't exist. The correlations are real and they are instantaneous. So does this mean information can travel faster than light? Can we use entanglement to send messages instantaneously across the universe?

No. And this is a crucial point. Entanglement cannot be used to transmit information. When you measure your photon, you get a random result, vertical or horizontal, with equal probability.

You can't control what result you get. And because you can't control it, you can't encode a message in it. The correlations between the two photons only become apparent when you compare your results. And that comparison has to happen through ordinary slower than light communication.

So uh entanglement is spooky but it doesn't break the speed of light. The universe is cleverly designed if you can even use that word to prevent faster than light information transfer even in the face of instantaneous quantum correlations. This is one of the things I find most beautiful about physics. There's this deep consistency to the universe.

The different pieces of the puzzle, relativity, quantum mechanics, information theory, they all fit together in a way that's incredibly tight. The speed of light is protected. Causality is protected. No matter how clever you are, no matter how hard you try, you cannot send information faster than light.

The universe won't let you. Now, let me talk about something that might seem like a tangent, but is actually deeply connected to everything we've discussed. the electromagnetic spectrum. When most people think about light, they think about uh visible light, the narrow band of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect.

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. That's it. That's all we see. But visible light is a tiny tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum.

A ridiculously tiny fraction. The electromagnetic spectrum extends from radio waves with wavelengths of meters or even kilometers all the way up to gamma rays with wavelengths smaller than an atom. And here's the thing, all of these are light. Radio waves are light.

Microwaves are light. Infrared is light. Ultraviolet is light. X-rays are light.

Gamma rays are light. They're all the same thing. electromagnetic radiation, photons, just at different frequencies and wavelengths. The only difference between a radio wave and a gammaray is energy.

A gammaray photon has enormously more energy than a radio wave photon, but they're both photons. They both travel at C in a vacuum. They both have wave particle duality. They both obey the same laws of physics.

So, when you use your microwave oven to heat your food, you're literally bombarding it with light. When your radio picks up a signal from a radio station, it's detecting light. When you get an X-ray at the dentist, the dentist is shining light through your teeth. It's all light.

This unified picture, the idea that all electromagnetic phenomena are manifestations of a single force carried by a single type of particle, the photon is one of the great intellectual achievements of physics. It was first understood by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s when he unified electricity and magnetism into a single theory. Maxwell showed that changing electric fields create magnetic fields and changing magnetic fields create electric fields and these two fields can leapfrog each other through empty space propagating as a wave. And when he calculated the speed of this wave he got exactly the speed of light.

That was a stunning discovery. Maxwell didn't know he was going to get the speed of light. He was just doing the math, following the equations where they led. And out popped the speed of light, perfectly matching the measured value.

That was the moment when physicists realized that light is electromagnetic radiation. But even Maxwell didn't fully understand what was going on. It took Einstein 50 years later to really grasp the deep significance of the speed of light. Einstein realized that the speed of light isn't just the speed of electromagnetic waves.

It's the speed of causality itself. It's the fundamental speed limit of the universe built into the structure of spaceime. And that's why C, the speed of light, shows up in relativity. Not because Einstein was thinking about light specifically, but because he was thinking about the structure of spacetime.

The speed of light is the conversion factor between space and time. It's what links the two into a single unified spaceime. In fact, uh some physicists argue that we should stop calling it the speed of light altogether because that phrase implies it's a property of light specifically. It's not.

It's a property of spaceime. Light just happens to travel at that speed because photons are massless. If photons had mass, even a tiny tiny mass, they would travel slower than C, but C would still be C. The speed limit would still be there.

Let me get into something really speculative now because I think it's one of the most fascinating questions about light in the universe. Why does light travel at the speed it does? Why is C what it is? Why 300,000 kilometers/s and not some other number?

This is a surprisingly deep question and the answer is subtle. In one sense, the numerical value of C doesn't matter. It depends on your units. In meters/s, it's about 300 million.

In miles/s, it's about 186,000. In light years per year, it's exactly one. The number changes depending on how you define your units of length and time. What matters is the dimensionless constants of nature numbers that don't depend on units.

One of the most important of these is the fine structure constant usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha. It's a number that involves the speed of light plank's constant and the charge of the electron all combined in such a way that the units cancel out and its value is approximately 1 over 137. The fine structure constant determines the strength of the electromagnetic force. It determines how strongly light interacts with matter.

It determines the structure of atoms, the colors of stars, the chemistry of the universe. Why is it 1 over 137? We have no idea. It's one of the great mysteries of physics.

If it were significantly different, say one over 100 or one over 200, the universe would look completely different. Atoms might not be stable. Stars might not shine the way they do. Life as we know it might be impossible.

This is what physicists call a fine-tuning problem. And it connects to deep questions about why the universe has the physical constants it has. Some physicists think there might be a deeper theory that explains these constants from first principles. Others think we might just be one universe among many part of a vast multiverse and we happen to live in one where the constants are just right for complexity and life.

I've gone back and forth on this over my career. I was one of the people who developed the string theory landscape. The idea that there are an astronomical number of possible universes with different physical constants. It's controversial and not everyone agrees with it.

But it does suggest that the value of the speed of light and all the other constants might not be as mysterious as we think if there are enough universes to try every possible combination. But regardless of whether the multiverse is real, the fact remains in our universe, light travels at exactly 299 million 792,458 m/s in a vacuum. It's one of the most precisely known numbers in all of science. And it's one of the most important.

Let me bring this back to something personal. When I was younger, long before I became a physicist, I used to look up at the night sky and wonder about the stars. I had no idea, no idea at all, that the light hitting my eyes from those stars was carrying information about the past. That I was literally looking backward in time every time I looked at the sky.

Now I understand that, and it still takes my breath away. The light from Betalgus, that reddish star in Orion, has been traveling for about 700 years before it reaches your eye. You're seeing that star as it was 700 years ago. It might have changed dramatically since then.

For all we know, it might have exploded into a supernova already, and we just haven't seen it yet because the light from that explosion hasn't reached us. Light is our only messenger from the distant universe. Everything we know about what's out there, every galaxy, every star, every nebula, we know because of light that traveled from there to here. And every one of those photons, every single one experienced zero time during its journey.

There's something profoundly poetic about that, even though I'm a physicist and I usually try to keep poetry out of my work. These photons, these tiny packets of energy zip across the cosmos in what amounts to an instant from their own perspective carrying the light and information of entire civilizations of stars, entire histories of galaxies. And they do it without experiencing a single moment of time. Light doesn't move in the deepest sense.

It connects points in spaceime, but it doesn't experience the journey between them. It's more like a bridge than a vehicle. A bridge between the past and the present, between distant stars and your own eyes, between the beginning of the universe and right now. That's what light really is.

Not a wave, not a particle, not an electromagnetic disturbance. It's a connection, a thread woven into the fabric of spaceime itself, linking events that might be separated by millions of light years and millions of years, but are from the photon's perspective one and the same. And that to me is far more beautiful and far more profound than anything science fiction has ever imagined about light and speed and the cosmos. Let me wrap this up by coming back to the beginning.

You thought light moves. You thought it travels from one place to another taking time to make the journey. And in a sense, in our sense, in the sense of what we observe with our instruments and our clocks, that's true. Light does take 8 minutes to get from the sun to the earth.

It does take years to cross interstellar distances. But in the deepest sense, in the sense of what's really happening in the structure of spaceime, light doesn't move at all. It doesn't experience time. It doesn't experience distance.

It exists at both end points simultaneously. The journey is an illusion, a consequence of how we experience spaceime, not a feature of how light experiences it. And there's more. Light isn't just one thing.

It's a whole spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays, all unified by the same physics. It can be slowed down, stopped, even frozen without violating any fundamental law. It can be entangled with other light across cosmic distances, exhibiting correlations that are instantaneous, but can never be used to send information faster than the speed of light. Light is weird.

Light is deeply, fundamentally weird. And after 50 years of studying it, I can tell you that we still don't fully understand it. There are still open questions, still mysteries, still things that keep physicists up at night. But here's what I love about it.

The more we learn about light, the more connected everything becomes. Light connects electromagnetism to spaceime. Light connects the quantum world to the classical world. Light connects the past to the present.

Light is in a very real sense the glue that holds our understanding of the universe together. So the next time you look at the sun or see a rainbow or turn on a lamp, remember what you're experiencing is not what you think it is. What you're experiencing is one of the most profound and mysterious phenomena in the entire universe. And we're only just beginning to understand it.

That's what makes physics exciting. That's what makes light exciting. After all these centuries, after all we've learned, the universe can still surprise us with the simplest things. Light doesn't move the way you think.

And that's a beautiful, wonderful, magnificent fact. Thank you for listening. Now, go look at the sky and think about all the photons hitting your face right now that have been traveling for years, centuries, millennia, and experiencing not a single second of it. Think about that.

Really think about it and welcome to the real universe.
