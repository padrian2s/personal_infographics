If you want to go deeper into these ideas beyond what a video can offer, I've gathered them into a single book. You'll find the link in the description. I'm going to tell you something that will challenge one of the most basic intuitions you have about yourself. Something that goes against what seems obvious, what seems undeniable, what you experience every single day.

Your mind is not in your head. Not entirely. Not in the way you think. When I ask where is your mind, you probably point to your skull, to your brain.

That's where thinking happens, right? That's where consciousness resides. That's where you are located. But I'm going to argue that this picture is wrong or at least it's incomplete.

Your mind, your cognitive processes, your thoughts, your memories, your decision-m doesn't stop at the boundary of your skull. It extends outward into your body, into your environment, into the tools you use, into the people you interact with. The mind is not a place. It's a process.

And that process is distributed across brain, body, and world in ways that make the question where is the mind fundamentally confused. I'm Leonard Suskin. I've spent my career thinking about the nature of information, locality, and how physical processes are distributed in space. And I want to convince you that our common sense picture of the mind as being in the brain is as wrong as the pre capernican picture of the earth being at the center of the universe.

Let me start with a thought experiment proposed by philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmer's in a famous 1998 paper called the extended mind. Imagine two people Ingging and Otto. Eningga is a healthy normal person. She wants to go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

She recalls that the museum is on 53rd Street. She walks to 53rd Street and goes to the museum. Now consider Otto. Otto has Alzheimer's disease.

He can't store new memories in his brain. So Otto carries a notebook everywhere. When he learns something important, he writes it in the notebook. When he needs to recall information, he consults the notebook.

Otto also wants to go to the Museum of Modern Art. He consults his notebook, which tells him the museum is on 53rd Street. He walks to 53rd Street and goes to the museum. Question.

Do Ingga and Otto both believe that the museum is on 53rd Street? Most people would say yes for Inga. Obviously, she believes it. She remembers it.

But what about Otto? Does he believe it or does he merely have access to the information via his notebook? Clark and Charas argue Otto believes it just as much as Inga does. The only difference is the physical substrate of the belief.

For Ingga, the belief is stored in neural connections in her brain. For Otto, the belief is stored in ink marks in his notebook. But uh functionally in terms of how the information guides behavior, how it's accessed when needed, how it's updated when necessary, the notebook plays the same role for Otto that biological memory plays for Eningga. Therefore, Clark and Charas conclude the notebook is part of Otto's mind.

His cognitive system extends beyond his brain to include the notebook. His mind is not entirely in his head. part of it is in his pocket. This is the extended mind thesis and it's deeply strange.

Now, before you dismiss this as philosophical word games, let me tell you why I think this idea is important and why it connects to fundamental questions in physics. In physics, we're used to the idea that where something is located depends on how you define something. Consider an electron. Where is an electron in quantum mechanics?

Before you measure it, the electron doesn't have a definite position. It's described by a wave function that's spread out over space. The electron is in some sense everywhere the wave function is non zero. Only when you measure the position does the wave function collapse and the electron localized to a particular spot.

But where the electron is depends on your interaction with it on the measurement you perform. Similarly, where the mind is might depend on how you define the mind and what cognitive processes you're examining. Let me make this more concrete with some examples from cognitive science and neuroscience. Consider mental arithmetic.

When you calculate 347* 28 in your head, what's happening? You might use various strategies. You might uh visualize the numbers. You might break the calculation into steps.

You might use verbal working memory, literally talking to yourself internally. You might even gesture with your hands using embodied representations to help structure the problem. All of these strategies recruit different parts of the brain. Visual imagery activates visual cortex.

Verbal working memory activates language areas. Hand gestures activate motor cortex and parietal regions. But now imagine you have a pencil and paper. You write down the problem.

You perform the multiplication algorithm step by step on paper. Where is the cognition happening? Part of it is in your brain. You're reading the numbers, applying rules, making decisions.

But part of it is on the paper. The paper stores intermediate results. Makes certain patterns visible. Offloads working memory demands.

The cognitive process is distributed. It's a loop between brain and paper with information flowing back and forth. To ask where is the calculation happening is to ask a question that doesn't have a simple answer. Is it in your brain partially?

Is it on the paper also partially? The calculation is a process that spans both. Now you might object but Lenny the paper doesn't do any thinking. It's just passive storage.

The real thinking happens in the brain. But what does thinking mean? If thinking means processing information, transforming it according to rules, then the paper is participating. It's storing information in a structured format.

It's making certain transformations easier. It's enabling computations that would be difficult or impossible to do purely in your head. The distinction between active processing and passive storage is not as clear-cut as it seems. Let me give you another example.

Language. When you think in language, when you have an internal monologue, you're using a tool that exists outside your head. Language is a cultural artifact. It was invented by humans over millennia.

It exists in dictionaries, in grammar books, in the collective practices of language speakers. You learned language from other people. You internalized it. Now you use it to structure your thoughts.

But is language part of your mind or is it an external tool that your mind uses? The extended mind thesis says it's both. Language is external in its origin and in its cultural existence, but it's internal in how you use it. It structures your cognition, enables certain kinds of thoughts, shapes how you perceive and remember.

The boundary between internal and external is fuzzy. Now I want to connect this to something I've worked on extensively. The holographic principle in physics. The holographic principle says that all the information contained in a volume of space can be encoded on the boundary of that volume.

The three-dimensional interior is in some sense a projection of information stored on the two-dimensional surface. This came out of studying black holes. Jacob Beckinstein and Steven Hawking discovered that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon, not its volume. This suggested that the information is fundamentally stored on the surface, not in the interior.

My work with Gerard Huft and later with Juan Maldesina's ad CFT correspondence developed this into a general principle. In quantum gravity, information is not localized in the bulk of space. It's distributed on boundaries. Now, this doesn't directly apply to cognition.

Brains are not black holes. And the holographic principle is about quantum gravity, not neuroscience. But conceptually, there's a parallel. The holographic principle tells us that asking where is the information can have a nonobvious answer.

Information that appears to be localized in three-dimensional space might actually be encoded on a two-dimensional boundary. Similarly, asking where is the mind might have a non-obvious answer. Cognitive processes that appear to be localized in the brain might actually be distributed across brain, body, and environment. Let me talk about embodied cognition because this is where the extended mind thesis becomes particularly compelling.

Your body is not just a vehicle for your brain. Your body participates in cognition. Consider how you catch a ball. You don't calculate trajectories using Newtonian mechanics.

You don't explicitly solve differential equations in your head. Instead, you move your body to keep the ball at a constant angle in your visual field. This is a simple control law that works without any explicit trajectory calculation. The cognition involved in catching a ball is distributed between perception, motor control, and the physical dynamics of your body moving through space.

It's not happening in your head. It's happening in the coupling between your eyes, your motor system, and the world. Or uh consider how you navigate through a crowded room. You don't build a detailed internal map and plan a route.

You use your body to explore the space, adjusting on the fly based on what you perceive. The psychologist JJ Gibson called this ecological psychology. The idea is that perception is not about building internal representations of the world. It's about detecting affordances, opportunities for action that the environment provides.

And this detection is embodied. It depends on your body's capabilities, on what you can do, on how you can move. From this perspective, cognition is not centralized in the brain. It's distributed across the brain body environment system.

It's a process of continuous interaction, not a computation happening inside a skull. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "This is all very interesting, but surely consciousness is in the brain. When I'm conscious, I'm experiencing something happening in my brain.

That's where the subjective experience is located." And you're right that consciousness seems to be intimately tied to brain activity. Damage to certain brain regions affects consciousness. Anesthetics that suppress brain activity eliminate consciousness. Neural activity and conscious experience are tightly correlated.

But uh correlation is not the same as location. The fact that brain activity is necessary for consciousness doesn't mean consciousness is located in the brain in any simple sense. Consider this. When you see a red apple, where is the experience of redness located?

Is it in your visual cortex where neurons are firing in response to light at 650 nm? Is it in higher cortical areas where object recognition happens? Is it in the frontal cortex where attention and awareness are thought to reside? Or is the redness somehow in the apple itself in the interaction between your visual system and the physical properties of the apple surface?

These questions don't have clear answers. The experience of redness is not localized to a particular place in your brain. It's a property of the entire system, brain, body, light, object engaged in a particular kind of interaction. David Chomers, who co-authored the extended mind paper, has also written about what he calls the hard problem of consciousness, the problem of explaining why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience.

I don't claim to solve that problem. Nobody has. But I think the extended mind thesis suggests that we're asking the question wrong if we assume consciousness must be localized to the brain. Consciousness might be more like temperature than like mass.

Temperature is not localized to individual molecules. It's a property of large collections of molecules in certain configurations. Similarly, consciousness might not be localized to individual neurons or even to the brain as a whole. It might be a property of the entire system in certain states.

Let me give you another example that I find fascinating. Social cognition. When you have a conversation with someone, where is the thinking happening? Obviously, each of you has thoughts in your own brain.

But the conversation itself, the exchange of ideas, the collaborative problem solving, the mutual understanding is not happening in either brain individually. It's happening in the interaction between the two of you. You complete each other's sentences. You pick up on subtle cues.

You build on each other's ideas. The resulting understanding is not reducible to what's in your head or what's in the other person's head. It emerges from the interaction. Uh some researchers call this distributed cognition or socially extended cognition.

The idea is that cognitive processes can be distributed across multiple people. Think about scientific collaboration. When Einstein and Michelle Besso discussed relativity during their walks and burn, were they each thinking independently or were they engaged in a joint cognitive process that transcended either individual mind? I've experienced this in my own collaborations.

When Gerard Huft and I discussed the holographic principle or when uh Juan Maldina and I discussed ads CFT, the insights that emerged didn't come from my mind alone or his mind alone. They came from the interaction from the back and forth from ideas bouncing between us. The cognition was distributed across both of us plus the whiteboards we used plus the papers we referenced plus the mathematical structures we manipulated. Where was the mind in those moments?

Not in my head, not in my collaborator's head, in the system formed by both of us in interaction with our tools and our shared environment. Now, I want to address an objection that's often raised against the extended mind thesis. The objection goes like this. If Otto's notebook is part of his mind, then by the same logic, the internet is part of everyone's mind and the library is part of my mind when I look up information.

And my calculator is part of my mind when I use it. This is absurd. The mind can't include everything we interact with. Clark and Charmers anticipated this objection.

They proposed some criteria for when external resources count as part of the mind. One, the resource must be reliably available and typically invoked. Two, the information from the resource must be more or less automatically endorsed, trusted without reflection. Three, the information must have been consciously endorsed at some point in the past.

Four, the information must be easily accessible when needed. Otto's notebook meets these criteria. He carries it everywhere. He trusts it completely.

He consciously wrote the information in it. He can access it easily. The internet, by contrast, might not meet all these criteria for most people. It's not always reliably available.

The information isn't automatically trusted. Access isn't always easy. But here's what's interesting. For someone who's constantly connected, who has a smartphone in their pocket at all times, who reflexively looks up information online, who trusts Google search implicitly, the internet might indeed be part of their extended cognitive system.

The the boundary of the mind is not fixed. It depends on practices, on habits, on the coupling between individual and environment. And this brings me to something profound. The mind is not a thing.

It's a process. A dynamic ongoing process of interaction between brain, body, and world. When we ask where is the mind, we're making the same mistake as asking where is a wave. A wave is not a thing located somewhere.

Uh it's a pattern of motion, a process propagating through a medium. Uh you can point to where the wave is at a particular moment, but the wave itself is not localized in that way. Similarly, the mind is not a thing located in the brain. It's a process.

A process of information transformation of perception, action loops, of interaction with environment. The process extends beyond the brain in systematic and important ways. Let me connect this back to physics one more time because I think there's a deep lesson here. In physics, we've learned that locality, the idea that things have definite locations and interact only with nearby things, is subtle.

In quantum mechanics, entangled particles can be correlated in ways that seem to violate locality. Measure one particle, and you instantly know something about a distant particle, even though no signal travels between them. We resolve this apparent paradox by recognizing that information and correlation are not the same as causation and signaling. The particles don't influence each other faster than light, but they share information in a non-local way because they're part of a single quantum system.

Similarly, in cognition, we might need to recognize that mental processes are not simply located in brains. They're distributed across systems that include brains, bodies, and environments. The processes are non-local in the sense that they can't be cleanly decomposed into separate components happening in separate places. The mind like quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local phenomenon.

Now what are the practical implications of all this? If the mind extends beyond the brain, then how we structure our environment matters for how we think, the tools we use, the spaces we inhabit, the people we interact with. All of these shape our cognitive capabilities. When you're trying to solve a difficult problem, it matters whether you have a whiteboard to write on.

The whiteboard is not just a memory aid. It's part of your cognitive system. It allows you to externalize thoughts, to manipulate representations visually, to see patterns you couldn't see purely internally. When you're learning a new skill, it matters whether you have a teacher to guide you.

The teacher is not just providing information. They're providing a social scaffold for your cognition. Their demonstrations, their corrections, their encouragement, all of this is part of the learning process. When you're navigating a city, it matters whether you use GPS or learn to navigate by landmarks.

Using GPS might get you there faster, but it also changes how your brain represents space. People who navigate with GPS develop different hypocample structures than people who navigate by memory. The extended mind thesis says these are not just external aids to a mind that's really in your head. These are constitutive parts of the cognitive process.

They're part of how you think. And this has implications for how we design technology, how we structure education, how we think about cognitive enhancement and decline. Let me tell you about some fascinating research on brain plasticity that really drives this home. In neuroscience experiments, researchers have trained monkeys to control robotic arms using only their thoughts, reading neural signals directly from motor cortex, and translating them into arm movements.

What's remarkable is what happens to the monkeykey's brain over time. Initially, the monkey has to learn the mapping certain patterns of neural activity produce certain arm movements. But after extensive training, something extraordinary occurs. The monkeykey's brain reorganizes.

The cortical representation of its body expands to include the robotic arm. Neurons that previously responded only to the monkeykey's biological limbs start responding to the robotic arm. The robotic arm becomes incorporated into the monkeykey's body schema. The internal model of its body that the brain maintains.

From the monkeykey's perspective, the robotic arm is part of its body. Not metaphorically, literally. The neural representation has extended beyond the biological boundary. Now, extend this to humans.

People who use prosthetic limbs report similar experiences. After months or years of use, the prosthetic doesn't feel like a tool they're using. It feels like part of their body. They can control it intuitively.

They feel phantom sensations in it. It's incorporated into their body schema. Where is the self in this case? Is it limited to the biological body or does it extend to include the prosthetic?

The neuroscience suggests the latter. The brain's representation of the body is plastic. It adapts based on reliable correlations between motor commands and sensory feedback. And when those correlations extend beyond the biological boundary, when tools or prosthetics provide consistent predictable responses to neural commands, the brain incorporates them.

The boundary between self and world is not fixed by biology. It's determined by patterns of interaction and information flow. Let me give you another example from recent neuroscience. Brain computer interfaces.

Patients with lockedin syndrome, complete paralysis but intact consciousness can be fitted with implants that read neural signals directly. They learn to control cursors on screens to type messages, even to control robotic arms purely through thought. After training, these patients report that the interface doesn't feel like they're operating a machine. It feels direct, immediate, like moving their own limb.

The neural signals that once controlled biological muscles now control external devices. The causal chain has been rerouted, but the subjective experience is similar. The patients sense of agency, their feeling of control extends beyond their biological body to encompass the external device. Where is the mind in this case?

Purely in the brain or distributed across brain, computer interface and control device? I would argue it's the latter. The cognitive process of intentional action of deciding to move and experiencing the movement as under your control extends through the entire system. The computer interface is not just a tool.

It's a component of the cognitive process itself. Now, let me talk about something that connects more directly to my own work. The role of mathematical structures in cognition. When physicists work with mathematics, where is the understanding located?

Consider general relativity. Einstein's field equations are usually written as G minu= 8 pi g / c4t minu. This is a compact notation representing 10 coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Do I understand general relativity because I have the equations memorized in my brain?

Absolutely not. My understanding is distributed across neural patterns in my brain encoding mathematical intuitions. Motor skills in my hands for manipulating tensor indices. Visual representations I've internalized from diagrams.

External references I consult when needed. Computational tools I use for complex calculations. Conversations with colleagues about physical interpretation. The understanding is not in my head alone.

It's in the coupling between my brain and all these external resources. And here's what's crucial. Removing any of these components would degrade my understanding. If I lost access to paper and pencil, I couldn't work through complex derivations.

If I lost access to computational tools, I couldn't solve most realistic problems. If I lost access to the community of physicists, I'd lose the collective knowledge that informs interpretation. My understanding of general relativity is extended. It's not containable within my skull.

And I suspect this is true for all complex cognitive achievements. Mathematicians don't just have mathematics in their brains. Musicians don't just have music in their brains. Writers don't just have language in their brains.

In each case, the expertise is distributed across brain, body, tools, practices, and social structures. The mind extends into the domain of practice. If Otto's notebook is part of his mind, then losing the notebook is not just losing access to information. It's a form of cognitive damage.

It's more like uh losing part of your brain than like losing a tool. Similarly, if someone becomes dependent on smartphone apps for navigation, for memory, for calculation and then loses access to those apps, they haven't just lost a tool, they've lost part of their extended cognitive system, part of their mind. This raises ethical questions. What's our responsibility to maintain people's access to the external scaffolding they depend on?

If someone's mind extends into their environment, do we have obligations to preserve that environment? These aren't just philosophical questions. They're practical questions that affect how we care for aging populations, how we design cities, how we regulate technology. Let me end with a personal reflection.

When I look back at my career in physics, I realize that my best work was never done purely in my head. It was done in interaction with colleagues, with equations on paper, with physical intuition built from years of manipulating mathematical structures. My mind extends into the equations I write, into the diagrams I draw, into the conversations I have, into the papers I read. If you ask where is Lenny Suskin's understanding of holography, the answer is not in his brain.

It's distributed across notebooks, published papers, collaborations, mental models built over decades. The mind is not in the head. It's in the brain, yes, but also in the body, in the tools, in the environment, in the social interactions. It's a process that loops through all of these, creating a unified cognitive system.

And recognizing this, really understanding it changes how you think about thinking itself. Thank you for listening. Your mind is not where you think it is. And that's worth thinking
