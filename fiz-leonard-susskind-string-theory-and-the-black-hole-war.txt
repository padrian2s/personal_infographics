imagine a waterfall imagine the water in the river flowing down river and as it gets to the waterfall maybe the River Narrows the water gets faster and faster and at some point the water flows so fast that even sound cannot uh Escape person in a rowo passes a point of no return cannot roll faster than the FL of the water and so once you pass a certain point where the velocity is too strong to overcome you're doomed you're going to go over the waterfall the edge of the waterfall is like the Horizon of the black hole I don't know whether it's you or just circumstances that have always attracted you to what I'll refer to as The Cutting Edge whether it's in quantum gravity or black holes but were black holes something that always gripped you even before the black hole war no I was originally a particle physicist uh and my interests were Elementary particles not gravity in fact when I was a very young physicist was con considered by most particle physicists that gravity was a waste of time that uh the quantum mechanics of gravity was very far away from any possible experiment and uh there was probably no way for the next 500 years I think dick feineman himself said he didn't want to work on the quantum mechanics of gravity because he thought it would take 500 years before we'd have any experimental evidence that was the General opinion and um I don't know if I shared it or all of the uh all of my senior all of my um Elders had that view and I more or less accepted it uh I worked on particle physics I worked on quarks I worked on all those kind of things um gravity only became really interesting to me around 1980 now that may seem like a long time ago to you but it's not so long ago for me what happened in 1980 um particle physics just ran out of steam there were no new experiments there was no good ideas about uh how to go past the standard model of particle physics it had gotten stuck badly stuck um it wasn't just me it was a large number mostly people younger than me who just said uh you know we we've this is just not the way to go let's worry about Gra gravity and maybe gravity will not be as hard gravity means quantum mechanics of gravity maybe it's not as hard as all those people were saying nobody studied it very much the other thing that made a big impact I have to say it made a big impact although I it didn't make an impact on me until around 1980 was Steph Hawkings discovery that black holes have apparate that uh as a consequence of quantum mechanics black holes of operate uh and his claim that that meant that information is lost uh inside a black hole and can never be regained that struck me very deeply I suspected that was wrong didn't sound right my friend the in Holland who was a very famous physicist also didn't believe it we talked about it and um I think the thing that really precipitated my interest was a meeting that took place I think it was around 1980 or 1981 uh in a mansion in San Francisco where a Ted I Hawking and a good number of other people met and Hawking made his claim that information is lost when black holes evaporate was there I was there and we were both both very very puzzled sure Steven was wrong and um that was the kind of problem that I really can get my hands into but I really like when there's a kind of clash of principles quantum mechanics saying information can never be lost gravity apparent black holes apparently telling you that information is lost there was a conflict of principle two different ways to think about nature were leading to radically different and not just different but opposing views of the relation between quantum mechanics and gravity and you know once you get hooked on a thing like that uh if you have the particular mental makeup that I have you're stuck you're going to you're you're not going to turn back one of the major themes of the black hole war is this really deep conflict between quantum mechanics on the one hand you at hoofed and then general relativity the relativist like Steven Hawking on the other and I have had some conversations on the show about topics adjacent to this area so I've spoke I spoke with Juan Malina all about holography but for our listeners who no keep in mind Juan is of course a very great physicist but he's a good deal younger and so he wasn't present during this period when uh uhh when all of this conflict was taking place yeah all I wanted to say though was just for our listeners who haven't listened to those conversations who aren't physicists I think it would be really good to start out just by laying out the the basics of black holes of entropy that are necessary to understand this war so just what is a black hole that led relativists to believe that information would get sucked in and trapped there okay black holes are objects which are so gravitationally powerful or intense the matter within a black hole is so concentrated that a horizon forms around them the Horizon is or I think one way to put it is that it's a point of no return um anything that falls past the Horizon of a black hole is sucked in and can't get out or at least that's the classical gravitational um view of what a black hole is uh could explain it here's a way we might explain it imagine a waterfall imagine the water in the river flowing down river and as it gets to the waterfall maybe the River Narrows the water gets faster and faster and at some point the water flows so fast that even sound cannot uh uh Escape person in a robo uh passes a point of no return cannot roll faster than the flow of the water and so once you pass a certain point where the velocity is too strong to overcome you're doomed you're going to go over the waterfall the edge of the waterfall is like the Horizon of the black hole or the place better yet the place where you can no longer Escape it's the point of no return that's the Horizon of the black hole now we're not in robots and we're not worried about sound what we're worried about is light if the flow of the river could somehow exceed the speed of light then light could never escape from some point of no return that's exactly what a black hole is it's a point where light and if light then nothing else can escape uh the pull of gravity that's the Horizon the point of no return um so black holes are fundamentally objects with horizons with a point of no return that's what we can think of them as um what Steven said is if there's a point of no return Then anything carrying some information it could be uh almost anything carries information could be a book when it flows past the point of no return it's lost it's permanently lost to the outside world and that's fine so what it's lost to the outside world but it's in the black hole but then Stephen also said But black holes evaporate so in the end of the day something has fallen into the black hole carried some information with it carried some distinctions there could be distinctions about what fell into the black hole it uh might have been one of two books it could either be um uh Stephen Hawkings book or my book the uh the different they're different okay the distinction between what fell in will simply be annihilated because nothing can escape from the black hole but on the other hand the black hole evaporates so there you have it information must be fundamentally lost on the other hand quantum mechanics is a theory where information is never lost it can get scrambled it can get uh put into a form which is highly inaccessible uh but with enough effort one should always be able to recover information of any kind and um one possibility is that the evaporation products of the black hole the radiation which goes off the Hawking radiation actually carries that information but Steven said no no that's not the way black holes work anything that falls in is lost so there we had it a conflict of principle gravity and black holes said information is lost Quantum mechanic says it can never be lost and that was the uh that was the class of principle that uh motivated me very few people were terribly interested in it t was the only other one that I know which is surprising just because black holes are today I mean one of the most one of the hottest topics yep but yep I I recently correct was in New York City and interviewed Jan 11 about black holes and she really had a lot of nice things to say about your work and how in is an old friend yeah one don't believe don't believe nice things said by old friends uh but one thing that we discussed is whether or not the singularity at the center of a black hole is real because a number of physicists I've spoken with like Jana or Eric verinda they kind of view the black hole exclusively as the Horizon well and I just was wondering how you think about this well okay this is also very puzzling um you may say that the black hole is only what is outside the Horizon if no information ever gets lost just say everything is outside the Horizon but you also have to ask the question what if you fell through the Horizon of the black hole what would happen most people believe most people who study gravity and I'm certainly one of them that would believe that very very much like a waterfall when the waterfall you're flowing down the river in a rowboat you pass the point of no return what happens to you when you pass the point of no return nothing you're just moving a little bit faster than uh than you can row back if you're just floating down the river you feel nothing nothing special happens at that point that's what's believed by most physicists at least of my uh uh most physicists like myself that if you fell through the Horizon of a black hole you would feel nothing you would just sail through through just like the rowboat uh falling past the point of no return so I don't think you can say that just forget about the inside of the black hole just say the edge of the black hole is the Horizon and there nothing inside it uh we're stuck with a puzzle yes if you're outside the black hole and you always stay outside the black hole every observation that you can ever make is consistent with the idea that there's nothing inside the black hole just the Horizon on the other hand if you're in a frame of reference falling through falling in you will pass the black hole Horizon and you will have a perfectly good life at least if the black hole is big enough at least until you approach The Singularity things get tough at the singularity yeah that's a bad that's a bad place but the Horizon perfectly smooth you know what it's like again it's like the uh the waterfall when you pass the point of no return in the river that's just where the velocity of the flow is a little bit faster than you can roll yourself out of nothing special happens where does the really bad stuff happen when you go over the waterfall and crash on the Rocks below the singularity is like the Rocks below the Horizon is like the point of no return and um uh so I don't think it's possible just to say there's nothing inside the the black hole Horizon an observer Who falls through we'll see a perfectly ordinary SpaceTime on the other side but somebody on the outside will uh will reckon that nothing ever went through the Horizon so it's a little bit crazy very counterintuitive and we've wrestled that with that U pretty much uh since I would say around 1980 I mean the the question that immediately comes to mind is are there two different realities then or just two different ways of looking at the same thing yeah I think it's two different ways of looking at the same thing um what happens from the outside when something falls from the perspective from the outside is when something Falls toward the Horizon it gets all scrambled up and becomes highly inaccessible to the ordinary means of retrieving information information can get badly scrambled to the point where I'll give you an example um you uh again start with a book and now we burn the book uh everything goes up in smoke the information in the book is lost no not according to the really precise rules of quantum mechanics the really precise rules of quantum mechanics say that that information is there in the smoke but very hard to retrieve it's gotten too scrambled it's gotten too mixed up it's gotten too um inaccessible you you'd have to know every molecule of smoke you'd have to know every single atom of smoke exactly where it is exactly where it's moving how fast it's moving if you knew all of that and remember the number of molecules of smoke in a burned book is what 10 to the 30th or some ridiculously large number if you had the capacity to uh to process all of that information you could recover whether the book was Steven's book or my book but it would be very very hard very very complex so in practice you say the information is lost but none in principle was thought the same thing is true of black holes if you're on the outside of the black hole what you see is all this Hawking radiation coming out and that Hawking radiation is carrying the information of what fell in on the other hand if you fall through everything is perfectly normal and the information passes to the inside what we've kind of learned is that the inside and the outside are not two different things they're really representations of the same thing is this black hole complimentarity that's black hole complimentarity that there're that they're two different expressions of the same information uh and uh they're not I wouldn't say say they were two different realities I would say they were two different mathematical representations of the same thing this happens in mathematics and physics sometimes that uh that different things can be expressed uh in different form transformations of one thing can look very very peculiar from from the other point of view and that's pretty much what we think that that what falls into the interior which you see when you fall through is a kind of mathematical transformation of what's seen from the outside but both carry the same information yeah that's what's called black hole complimentarity um and uh that was that was a sort of last ditch effort to try to make sense out of these two different views but it turned out to be right or at least it turned out to be very consistent with what um 80 90 2000 2010 2020 40 years ago uh was a wild conjecture uh it is now almost completely believed by the younger class of physicists who study these things okay just to to push this thought experiment a little bit farther of of kind of rowing the boat and there not being this huge difference Beyond this point of no return in the velocity I've just heard that a lot of crazy things happen once you pass the Event Horizon of a black hole such as the space and time coordinates flipping and no no no no that's that's uh crazy things happen in the mathematics in some of the mathematics we've learned what we've learned what all that means there's nothing crazy about it um in certain coordinates even ordinary what we call Flat space time that means SpaceTime with no black holes just ordinary empty SpaceTime in certain coordinates the same thing can happen a certain coordinate uh which was introduced by the mathematician to describe space it's not intrinsic to the uh uh to the SpaceTime itself a certain coordinate can on one side of a of a certain line be space likee and the other side Tim like nothing nothing unusual about that that um the media may play it up as a really wild thing but there's nothing wild going on um uh somebody falling through the Horizon does not see space turn into time he just sees space and he sees time okay and if he looks out of the black hole incidentally he doesn't see anything very peculiar on the outside somebody on the in right so uh that much is not a puzzle about space turning into time time turning into space that uh that's a way that the media has of trying to make uh make it sound very exotic okay yeah I was just wondering if there are any Sensational changes as you in the physics as you cross the Event Horizon but it sounds like no there AR as perceived by the person falling through no okay if the black hole is small then as you approach it there are large what are called tidal forces um but if the black hole is big enough then the approach to the Horizon is um a non-event or an almost non-event I was on the phone with my grandfather yesterday and he's 89 and he asked me if I had any interviews coming up and I was telling him about this one and he asked about it and black holes and something a question that he had so I'm assuming that a lot of our listeners have is he was puzzled by this concept of information because it sounds to him more like computer science than is it yes yes um computer science is certainly what's the right word infected its way into physics in a very very strong I infected is probably not the right word invaded or it wasn't the computer scientist who pushed it into physics it was the physicists who realized many of their needs for New Concepts was already there in computer science and one of them was this idea of information um but information it simply means distinctions between things um you say that there's certain information that's stored in the distinction between my book and Steven's book uh now there are many many pages in both books they're different from each other and so the number of bits of information the number of distinctions that characterize the difference between his book and my book is large and the both books have more than 100,000 words each word has maybe 10 letters each letter is a a thing on the printed page with lots of pixels and pixels are made out of atoms so all of those are distinctions but there's a finite number of them some very large number of distinctions uh that uh that distinguish the two books that's what information is it's just distinctions between things and that's what computer science is about distinguishing different um uh messages for example do dot Das dott Dash is different than dash dot Das dot dot dot mean Mor code is what I'm talking about um so when I send you a m code me message saying I love my cat uh and I uh and you might have thought that I said I hate my dog you can look at the individual pieces of the MOS code and you can recover what I said even though the M code may just seem like a bunch of garbled uh nonsense to most people if you know the code if you know the code you can recover the distinction between the two things okay so what are we talking about what distinctions are we talking about for a black hole a black hole could be created for example by a star collapsing all the material of the star fill in but a black hole could also be constructed by just a large number of particles being focused in and sent in toward a point enough particles Ordinary Elementary particles electrons protons neutrons positrons uh anti particles of all kinds shoot them in and when they come in they will form Horizon and you have two black holes which are formed in very very different ways now the classical black hole Solutions the solutions of general relativity don't admit any distinction between these they just are black holes all black holes look the same that's what drove Steven to say information is lost what information the information about whether it was formed by a collapsing star or bunch of Elementary particles that came together there huge distinctions between the two but they they appear to be lost when the black hole forms what we've discovered is that information is not lost it's there in the outgoing Hawking radiation so that uh that seems to be what's going on and just to translate this idea of these so these fundamental pieces of information are called bits bits and what are bit how do you make bits rigorous as a physicist well that's that's a difficult question um sometimes a physical system is set up in a language for which bits not if it's a quantum mechanical system they're called cubits which means Quantum bits which are a little different than just the bits in your ordinary computer but never mind that distinction for a minute certain physics problems are naturally amendable to being expressed in terms of bits other physical problems are not so natural to express them in terms of bits [Music] um so sometimes the use of the language of bits in computer science and so forth is a little bit unnatural for for certain physics problems for example physics problems involving continuous Fields what bits are good for is when your description involves something very discrete some very discrete variables um what it's not so good for is systems which are described by Continuum mechanics but in quantum mechanics everything is discret that's the difference between classical and quantum mechanics everything is discrete and so it's thought that if we worked hard enough almost any kind of quantum system could be reduced to uh to a system of QB bits Quantum bits that has not been done for most uh for example it's not really been done for the standard model of particle physics but it's thought that because of quantum mechanics everything does reduce to uh to discrete information and could be represented in terms of cubits if only you worked hard enough to to translate it into that language one a slogan I wanted to ask about before we move on just a bit from information maybe is it from bit oh what what does that mean who said it John Wheeler John Wheeler was a Visionary uh his great contribution to physics was he did some good physics but but he was not one of the great uh technical physicists of his generation his great contribution was a vision and the transferring of that Vision to some very very brilliant students like Kip Thorne for example and uh have you worked with Kip Thorne I know Kip for years but uh no um okay so what was the vision the vision was that everything could be reduced down to bits every physical system could be represented in the language of bits even things which apparently seem to be described by continuous Fields because of quantum mechanics everything could be reduced to bits now he didn't use the word cubits Quantum bits the word didn't exist at that time he of course meant Quantum bits he could not possibly have thought that it was classical bits so uh John Wheeler had this Vision that physics could be reduced to well we could CL physics could be reduced to qu to uh to computer science quantum computer science not classical computer science that has turned out to be very much a uh a current theme it's not just a current theme it's what almost every uh physicist that I know who's working on these things believes so that was a vision his influence fluence on his students was Monumental and not just on his students but uh but many many other people and um so there was a greatness there even though his own technical contribution to physics was quite modest well in in keeping with this discussion of of some big figures I'd like to get back into the dialectic of the black hole War itself I never knew what dialectic meant back and forth discussion back and forth okay thank you tell now I know what dialect yeah and first I'd like to talk about one of the the figures who is very important especially at the beginning and that's Jacob beckenstein yeah and yeah so we shouldn't have left him out yeah so why was his contention that black holes have entropy both so shocking and so integral to the development of the the conflict okay so when does a system have entropy what is entropy first entropy is hidden information information that is really present in the system uh distinctions between two systems but sometimes that information is very difficult to perceive uh why one reason is it might be behind some closed door somewhere where you can't see it okay that's not so interesting another reason is because it might be contained among a a set of degrees of freedom which is just so numerous and so tiny and too so small that with our ordinary Co grain Vision with ordinary cost grained methods of observing the system you can't see all this fine grained information for example in a gas in a room think this room it's full of gas uh you can't see the gas even if you could see one or two molecules in the gas You couldn't possibly keep track of all of them right but the presence of all of them and the details and everything else have a huge amount of information uh about what that gas is like the details of it so entropy is hidden information either hidden because you just don't have access to it because it's in a locked box somewhere or more importantly because it's contained in so many degrees of freedom which are so tiny and so microscopic that you can't keep track of them that's what entropy is okay so the question then is do black holes contain information which is hidden that's what's believed it's believed that the Horizon of the black hole and later when the black hole evaporates uh contains all the information that fell into the black hole but it's hidden because it's so scrambled up among so many tiny degrees of freedom that we can't perceive it with uh with ordinary methods that's what it would mean for a black hole to have entropy it would mean that the structure the detail the quantum details of the Horizon can in principle tell you whether the black hole whether it was Steven's book or my book that fell into the black hole that in principle but it's so scrambled up and it's so um uh in the form of tiny microscopic details on the horizon that for all practical purposes it's inaccessible that's what entropy is why did um why did did Jacob think that black holes have enty well there was a number of reasons I think I think he sort of intuited that information can't be lost he intuited that and he said where can it be in the black hole it must be in Hidden details on the horizon I think that's what he was thinking uh that hidden details on the horizon must encode everything that fell in and he did some calculations on that basis and found a rather consistent story about the the uh Missing information or the entropy of the black hole for example there was a known fact about black hole well one of the things he said through some calculations which you can read about in my book incidentally um that the amount of information in a black hole is proportional to the area of the Horizon it was known from classical general relativity that the area of a horizon always increases never decreases well that's kind of interesting because the second law of Thermodynamics says that entropy is always increasing never decreases I suspect that uh I didn't know beckenstein very well I never asked him about this but I'm pretty sure he must have said to himself this fact that entropy never decreases and the fact that Horizon area never decreases must somehow be related somehow they must be the same fact and so that encouraged him with the idea that black holes have entropy and the entropy is proportional to the area of the Horizon it was a brilliant uh guess gu was a brilliant guess what he didn't realize uh this is the so-called First Love thermodynamics if something has entropy and it has energy then it has temperature that's the first law of thermodynamics D equals TDS don't worry about what that means that's the relationship between energy entropy and temperature so he didn't realize that one of the things he was saying is that black holes of temperature now Hawking recognized that and it first what he said we know that black holes don't have temperature that's ridiculous beckenstein must be wrong but then Hawking did his own calculation completely from a different point of view and found yes the black hole has temperature and it was consistent with what beckenstein had said about entropy but then Stevens realized something else he was very brilliant he realized if a thing has temperature it will radiate it will radiate photons and when it radiates photons it loses a bit of energy Mass when it loses energy it shrinks it's radiating away entropy and it's shrinking and he discovered the fact that black holes evaporate okay once he knew that and the argument was completely compelling black holes have entropy they have temperature they radiate like a black body uh and therefore give off energy and if they give off energy they evaporate and Shrink just like a puddle of water giving off molecules shrinks and disappears in the end well then he said wait a minute what happened to all the information which fell into the black hole black hole is not there anymore but it can't get out so information must be fundamentally lost he didn't take seriously the possibility that the radiation itself might be carrying off that information uh that is basically where we disagreed that the radiation carrying off the energy of the black hole is also carrying off the details of its formation uh and uh eventually he gave up and said yeah you guys must be right but you know I'd like to come back to Hawking and and the radiation in a minute but but first I I'd like to tie some things together and then maybe anticipate holography a bit and what I'm wondering is what is the connection between bits of information plank area units and the Horizon of of the black hole okay well and and maybe this is my plon or plank what do you say depends on whether you're German or uh okay if you're German you say plank most physicists will say plank I haven't heard plank for a long time okay plun um the plunk unit of length is just a terrible tiny unit of length that uh can be constructed out of gravitational units and Quantum mechanic you know quantum mechanical units H plunk constant when combined with um Newton's constant of gravity and the speed of light give a unit of length it's called the plunk length it's very very very small uh about 19 orders of magnetude smaller than a proton very small very very small there's a unit of area which goes with a unit of length you just Square the unit of length and you get as a unit of area that's about 10 Theus 66 square cm terribly tiny okay now the the what beckenstein discovered was that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the black hole measured in these plunk units so the think of the Horizon being tiled with little tiny pixels each pixel being about a plunk size count up how many pixels The Horizon has just all you have to do is div divide its area by the plunk area and that will tell you how much entropy it has so the three went together area entropy and the plunk area and I'm sure that this is another question that is coming to mind for a lot of people is is there's really nothing sort of special about the surface of a black hole Beyond its being a point of no return then how can information be stored on it if it's not really a physical surface okay I didn't say it wasn't a physical surface you okay I I said it's not a physical I said for somebody falling in uhhuh nothing happens special somebody on the outside doing experiments let's imagine you're on the outside of uh of the black hole what's keeping you there I don't know your Rockets are keeping you there or a string attached to somebody very very far away a rope is keeping you suspended above the black hole or you're orbiting the black hole one way or another uh you're either orbiting or suspended above the black hole and now you want to do experiments on it how can you do experiments you want to do experiments on the horizon well here's a way you could you could take a string you have a fishing fishing pole and a a nylon fishing line and at the end of the nylon fishing line you put a thermometer and you lower the fishing line down gravity is pulling pulling the thermometer down toward the uh toward the Horizon on the other hand you can reel it back in so you lower the thermometer down near the Horizon it records a temperature maybe it sends the temperature back to you or maybe you just reel it in and see what the the temperature was you discover that it had a the closer that that thermometer got to the Horizon the hotter that temperature was in fact you'll discover that if the thermometer went very close to the Horizon the temperature can be very very hot so it seems to be a reality at least in so far as experiments done from the outside seems to be a reality that there's a hot surface there on the other hand if you allowed yourself to fall in you would detect no hot surface at all not at all so you would say oh there was no hot surface there I think I'll tell my friend on the outside and therefore give him a contradiction my friend who stayed on the outside claimed that he did all these experiments and found a hot Horizon but I fell through that Horizon and there was no hot Horizon I'm going to tell him and then he's in a real quandry okay the problem is the guy who fell through the outside cannot commun fell through the Horizon cannot communicate with the outside he's past the Horizon past the point of no return cannot send the message out so it's all consistent you see person on the outside says Horizon is a real membrane it's a real thing it's hot it has properties it has electrical conductivity has all kinds of properties so he sends his buddy into the to pass through the Horizon and send them out a message telling him that whether there is or isn't anything there but the whole experiment gets frustrated by the fact that his friend who goes into the black hole cannot communicate with the outside so yeah that's that's that's the Dilemma if you like nothing inconsistent nothing inconsistent uh turns up uh but it it is I don't know whether to call it a dilemma or just a very counterintuitive property of black holes this is maybe getting a little bit ahead of myself here but I'm curious why if the information is not Lo lost and everything that goes into the black hole does eventually come out then wouldn't the person who passes over The Horizon's experience of there being something or nothing in there eventually get back out and yield a contradiction in some sense or another uh but I don't think he gets out any better than the person who jumped into a fire and comes out the in the smoke in the ashes if better yet so it's incomprehensible completely incomprehensible and not the and certainly not memory there's no memory of it in any ordinary human sense uh but uh it's like imagine you jumped into the Sun and uh got not only evaporated but ionized and uh and a million years later not a million years later a couple of billion years later the sun has completely given off all its energy and you're now told that all of your bits of information will be in that uh radiation that goes out it's very cold comfort it's not going to not going to mean that that radiation going out is you in any uh human sense that radiation can't think it can't do any of the things that you as a human being can do but nevertheless the details of who you were what you were like is encoded in that radiation that much that much incidentally um is not a conjecture that much is built into our rules of physics it's called unitarity in quantum physics doesn't matter what the word means it means exactly that that information can never be lost and it'll always appear although very badly scrambled and inaccessible so same thing with a black hole now moving on to another character so stepen Hawking of course is the figure opposing you in the black hole war was he a friend of yours what was he like as a person St and as a physicist all great well he was certainly a great physicist now you could ask a question an interesting question would Stephen Hawking be nearly as famous as a physicist if he wasn't Stephen Hawking by Steven Hawking I mean the man navigating the universe in his magical wheelchair okay no he would be considered an important 20th century physicist uh a very productive and more than productive a uh a great 20th century physicist but he would be an ordinary great physicist not an Einstein or probably not an Einstein I don't think an Einstein no um but still seriously great can I distract you for a moment and just ask who you think are the other Einstein of the 20th century I don't think there were any okay I don't think there were any I think he was uh he Newton and an ancient Greek that you probably never heard of named aristarchus who are the three great Geniuses of physics I think because I'm not sure I have heard of arist starus maybe it's worth a minute or two just saying who he was or what he did uh yeah arist starus was a Greek astronomer physicist I suppose you could call him a philosopher I never like the word philosopher very much I knew what it meant uh he put together so much of what we subsequently knew and understood about the universe I'm not talking about modern cosmology I'm talking about cernic cosmology capern that the earth goes around the sun the sun doesn't go around the earth he uh he put that together and for very modern reasons incidentally he understood that the motion of the planets was much better described by a Sun at the center and planets going around it than the earth at the center and everything going around it he figured out how to measure the distance to the Sun uh his his instruments were not sufficiently precise to make that measurement in detail but he did figure out that the sun was at least 60 times further than the moon it's much more more like 400 times further I think um he was the first one to realize that the stars are very very far away much further than the planets and he understood that you know what Parallax is Parallax is how things seem to shift in their relative positions when you move your head okay so he knew that from the motion of the Earth around the Sun which he had figured out that if the stars were closer you would see them apparently move in the sky as the sun went around the earth that's called Parallax you know you're seeing the stars from different positions and you should see them apparently move unless they're so far away that that that the angles are are too small so he was the first one to understand that the stars are very very far away away he didn't he was unable to say how far away there was a whole bunch of stuff which is be um which took almost 2,000 years to recover of the cernus and later uh and others that uh that aristarchus had figured out cernus knew about arist starus and he even writes about it in his in his book so yeah he was one of the great Geniuses of physics what happened to him is all of his writings were lost in Alexandria or no no no no no no no I don't think it was Alexandria I think it was before that I think the Romans probably destroyed it but a handful of his disciples including I think um uh what's the one who sat in the bathtub and said Eureka aredes Archimedes know about arist starus and others and uh and they mention in their own writings what aristois had discovered so uh I'm he was to me a Great Hero okay well thanks for that that was that was really interesting yeah um okay back to Hawking though before I derailed you so you don't think he he he's not up there with Newton arist darkus and Einstein well you know it's a matter of opinion I don't I I I wouldn't say no and I wouldn't say yes uh was he in the class with Fineman yeah I think he was in the class with Fineman um uh but then there are there are numerous people throughout the 20th century who were DQ uh in the first half of the 20th century I personally think Juan m theer is in a class well that P the paper on ads CFT correspondence is certainly had its impact yeah t was a great physicist in the same class for sure so I don't think we would see Hawking as a um as an absolute singularity in the sense that Einstein was but certainly one of the great physicists of the 20th century and um and deservedly so and we've talked a bit or we've mentioned many times times Hawking radiation and since that's also integral to the story I I know that you you probably can't get really in depth to what's actually happening Quantum mechanically you don't need to oh you don't need to you don't need to you just have to know that if a thing has energy now black remember that energy and mass are the same thing equals MC s energy and mass are really just the same thing black holes certainly have mass big ones have big Mass small ones have smaller Mass so black holes have energy beckenstein taught us that they have entropy and anything that has both entropy and energy has temperature that's all you really have to know anything that has temperature radiates that's the black body law anything with temperature will radiate automatically you don't need to calculate it uh and uh so once it has temperature it radiates now Hawking didn't believe this story so he did a different calculation which focused directly on the temperature of the black hole or the radiation from the black hole he did a calculation in Quantum field Theory which had he believed beckenstein would have been wouldn't have been necessary he did a calculation using Quantum field Theory to show that the quantum Fields outside a black hole would be excited would carry some extra energy and they would carry a flow of particles out away from the black hole that was a uh an alternate calculation to deriving the temperature of the black hole but a much more General view of it is that if it has entropy and it has energy it has temperature if it has temperature it radiates and just How cold are black hole oh very cold very very how long would it will it take for one to evaporate is that anything that could possibly be measured I I can't remember exactly I know I've done this calculation over many many times just uh just uh every time somebody asks me that question but roughly I think it was something like 10 to the 70 years or it was 10 to the 75 years very long time vastly longer or much longer than the age of the universe yeah much longer age of the universe today is about uh uh 10 to the 10th years 10 to the 13.8 sorry yeah no not 13.8 billion years okay we're talking about things like 10 to the 70th years much much longer so so that translates into saying that the black hole is very very cold is the rough future of the universe going to look like a bunch of black holes accreting sucking up most of the matter in the universe and then slowly evaporating into this gashes so nothingness um this of course depends on the on the details of cosmology up till very recently everybody believed there was this thing called Dark Energy they don't anymore they do okay okay but uh there's some tension about it it's called it's called a Hubble tension um mostly I suspect you should ignore it because I think it will go away we could talk about why phys why physics is always having these crises like this where things don't quite seem to fit together let's take it for granted that uh that this crisis called the Hubble tension will eventually go away that uh experiments will do better and uh and things will come into a line Okay so if everything lines up the way we always thought it always not always for the last 20 25 years the universe is accelerating in its expansion um but that indicates that it has a horizon now it's not a horizon like a black hole where we're outside the Horizon looking in it's a horizon surrounding us that we're looking out and seeing the Horizon incidentally The Horizon on the Earth is something that surrounds us right mhm if we if we're out on the sea and we look around us we see the Horizon surrounding us the Horizon of cosmology is like that if we look out far enough in all directions there's a horizon out there The Horizon is a point of no return anything that flows past it is lost okay so mostly what will happen we're at the center by definition we're not not because there's any special place called the center but because we were're very um uh arrogant about it and we say we're at the center we look out there's a horizon out there and what's going to happen trillion years or something like that all everything that isn't gravitationally bound to our galaxy stuff which is Flowing out with the Hubble uh expansion with the Hubble flow all of that will pass through the pass to the Horizon become invisible disappear and the only thing that will be left will be our galaxy which is held together by gravity it's not it's not participating in this expansion and uh and maybe the neighboring Galaxy which might fall into our galaxy and become part of it the Andromeda uh all the other galaxies will simply disappear move out flow out with the Hubble flow and just disappear so the universe will become very very empty except for ourselves because everybody on these other galaxies who's moving out they say exactly the same thing they think our galaxy is falling through their Horizon uh it's much like two ships on the two ships on the sea they're moving apart from each each other each one looks at the other and says oh that poor B no that poor fellow went over the horizon May that's funny he says he went over the horizon or she says he went over the horizon he says she went over the horizon neither one felt anything very special but both of them are right each one went over the other other the other one's Horizon that's what's going to happen everything will just flow out over the horizon and we'll be all we will truly be alone not our star will be alone but our galaxy will be alone scary yeah scary it's a lot uh but getting back to now I think we've got all of these big pieces of the puzzle on the table and we're ready to like get toward the solution of the black hole War but just to summarize it what is the black hole information Paradox then just what the standard way of putting it quantum mechanics says information can never be lost a naive view of black holes says that Things fall into the black hole can't get out the black hole evaporates so information is lost that's the puzzle it's a conflict of principle and along the way to the solution that you eventually came up with were there any that you tried out that just didn't end up working no no you're you're just kind of guided there so I was what I would say is I was puzzled for a long long time when Stephen presented his idea to aan myself in the mansion in San Francisco I think it was 1981 but I don't remember for sure I think it was 1981 um both at and I were greatly perturbed and sure he was wrong but we couldn't figure out why he was wrong both of us were very puzzled very confused sure Steven was wrong but could not figure out why so we were standing at the Blackboard um Stephen was grinning happily over our confusion I remember a TFT was sweating and looked angry it wasn't angry at anybody but he was very very puzzled and so was I so that I try and anything that didn't work no but I didn't try anything for a long time I was just confused well now is I think the right time for it hoofed to enter the story and you just said he was standing there he looked kind of angry whenry when frown on his face but it was a frown of concentration not a frown of anger but whenever I see photos of him he's always very welld dressed in a suit I've communicated with him over email he's very serious what's what's he like as a as a character and as a physicist that uh the first thing about him that if you get to know him is he's a man of enormous curiosity he's curious about everything how everything works how sea shells form uh and uh you can have the most delightful conversations with him um about almost anything it's not that he a know it all he's just thought about so many things uh so uh my wife and I used to love to have lunch with him when we visit UT in in the Netherlands just because he could he could she and he would talk about piano playing he was a very good pianist and uh and she played the piano he and I would talk about physics but sometimes we would talk about seashells and sometimes we would talk about uh The Human Condition yeah but he he's also a contrarian he tends to not listen to what other people say he uh and have his own very strong opinions and sometimes they strongly go against the grain um for example his views on quantum mechanics today are very different than um than most physicists he believes that in the end and quantum mechanics will be completely deterministic and uh he's worked very very hard look he's he's not a fool so he knows that quantum mechanics how quantum mechanics works better than almost anybody but he's absolutely convinced that at the Rock Bottom level or on the cosmic level or the the biggest and smallest levels when combined that quantum mechanics will be completely determined Min istic no probabilities perfectly completely deterministic not many physicists believe that um but some very prominent ones did I'd love to talk more about the just I think it's worth the digression because this is very interesting I know that for instance Boman mechanics is deterministic but he's definitely not a Boman me that's a naive very very naive uh uh attempt to uh to make quantum mechanics a tough much more subtle but so subtle that nobody else can understand it well yeah but that's what I was going to say I mean other um theories or interpretations like spontaneous collapse theories are not deterministic but then the Schrodinger equation evolves deterministically so I'm just wondering where it is that his intuition about determinism Falls and why you think it's at the core of quantum mechanics well in many examples where you where you prove that it's not deterministic you say things like I could measure the X component of the spin or the Y component of the spin I will randomly decide to choose the Y component and measure it okay and I'll get a random answer a tough view I think is there's nothing random about your choice about which it was determined completely from the beginning of the universe what direction you 13.8 billion years ago uh uh later would choose to make that measurement in and so the whole hypothesis that you could randomly or just as a matter of free will choose for example whether you choose to measure the position of a particle or the velocity there's an uncertainty principle it says you can't know both the position and the velocity at the same time What content is there in that uh if um you have to make a choice am I going to measure the and I might have many particles choose to measure this one position choose to measure that one velocity and collect statistics but um I think a TFT would say the choice of what you decide to measure is itself self deterministic and part of the whole deterministic story and if you take that into account that everything including the decision of what experiment to do which you think you can you have free will about whether you measure position or velocity if you assume that there's no free will about that that's all deterministic then I think he would say well I know he would say that the whole world becomes deterministic now that's a little bit crazy most physicists don't believe it's it's called super determinism or something I don't think most physicists think that on the other hand unlike like other people who have uh uh um these hidden variable views I think he would say that short of some incredibly complicated experiments that involves every particle in the universe simultaneously the rules of quantum mechanics as formulated by dra or whoever are absolutely correct for any possible me experiment that could possibly be done so he doesn't think that quantum mechanics is wrong in its predictive uh uh he just thinks there's some deeper understanding of it where it all become deterministic do I agree with him he's awfully damn smart he's proved to to to um uh to be right many times do I think he's right there probably not but uh I wouldn't dismiss him given that he had has all of these varied interests I'm curious about how you perceive his attitude toward physics it seems to me that he's not somebody who just thinks this is a fun game or Pastime he is very determined to get to the bottom of things and understand how the world Works he takes that very seriously AB absolutely he certainly does uh that's that's part of his curiosity he uh he his curiosity is so strong it's not a game it's an integral part of his personality it's an inter integral part of his psychological makeup and that kind of curiosity can only be shaded can only uh be um finished by knowing the answer so yeah he is very serious in that respect parent he's also got a good sense of humor incidentally but uh parenthetically is this also how you view physics very much so okay very much so uh yes I've always felt he's younger than me by about seven years but I've always seen him as a um I would say a role model in a certain sense um maybe he sees me as a role model I don't know but uh well yeah I remember telling him once uh it was at a birthday party of his in Holland I got up to give a birthday speech for him and I uh I said Herod that's his first name Gerard I completely agree with you and he said yes but I completely disagree with you that's very funny returning to the story though now that we've got our our cast we've got Gerard on at Hof on the stage how what is the holographic principle and how did the two of you end up coming up with this idea I'm not sure exactly what uh motivated him it it was certainly the observation that the entropy of a black hole the information in the black hole is stored on its surface for me um you know trying very hard to understand this what should we call it this conflict of views whether there is something on the inside of the black hole or whether it's all on the horizon and so forth at some point just more or less accidentally I remember the time exactly I was at Stanford and I was passing in the hallway at an exhibit there was an exhibit in the Stanford physics department apartment and it was an exhibit of a hologram and I looked at the Hologram it was a hologram of a very uh lovely young woman and she was smiling and moving it was oh she wasn't moving if you moved you would be able to see her from three dimensions and I looked at it and I said you know what this is very interesting the real information in that hologram is stored on the photographic the the the photographic um sheet of photographic material that was surrounding the empty volume but she appeared to be the three-dimensional figure inside this and I said you know what there's an example where two-dimensional information on a surface is completely equivalent in some sense to the information of the three-dimensional object which uh and that resonated with me and I said you know it is possible mathematically to encode information about three-dimensional systems on two-dimensional surfaces that struck me at the time as possibly an explanation of how all the information on the one hand could be on the horizon of the black hole and still make sense inside the black hole is full three-dimensional um it struck me that it was very similar in that respect to the way a hologram is both two-dimensional as a film as a piece of film and yet it was encoding a full three-dimensional reality in a sense uh that was probably a a silly reason to but when I saw that I said okay it must be that there's a mathematical equivalence between what's on the boundary of the system it doesn't even have to be a black hole on the boundary of of a region of space and things which take place inside it that was my coming to it through through through the idea of a hologram and through recognition that we had to somehow put together the idea that all the information is on the surface of the black coal on the horizon and yet it's encoding full three-dimensional stuff inside um I I don't know exactly what the tft's original motivation was I'm not sure I think it was something similar but we did have a chance to discuss it I think it was in 1994 and [Music] um he wasn't very open about it I don't really know why I think maybe maybe he wasn't sure it was right or what but I was visiting a t with with my wife and again we were sitting in a cafe someplace was summer it was a lovely day he was talking with her about piano playing and then we started to talk about physics and we both started to talk about Holograms he told me at that point that he had written a paper on it I didn't know about the paper and um I looked it up and I couldn't find it uh I had already composed my own paper but hadn't published it so is this the world as a hologram yeah yeah yeah so uh I put a reference into him and referenced the wrong paper we find it uh I didn't I didn't cut him out I mean I I refer the reference the wrong paper and at that point I knew that he understood it because we had spoken about it but I was pretty sure that he hadn't published the idea later on I found out that uh that he published it under a name not I don't mean I under a title which conveyed a completely wrong impression about what it was about yeah it's like higher dimensional reduction of something like dimensional reduction which has a completely different meaning in the in physics dimensional reduction something or other something or other didn't have hologram in it but yeah it was there so um that was quite exciting when that summer I remember we spent it in utra and um uh spent a lot of time exchanging ideas so the the holographic principle then is is just that if you have an n-dimensional volume all of that information can be encoded in an N minus one dimensional boundary okay very much analogous I'm not saying the same but very much analogous to the way the two-dimensional film encodes the uh the three-dimensional what we call the bulk and what is the status of this principle is it something that can be proven or it's a conjecture or it's a useful tool certainly a useful tool there's a there's a pattern in the in discoveries like this where they start out as wild speculations which nobody believes then they turn into principles deep principles of physics or science and then they become tools useful tools in studying other things originally the holographic principle was a wild conjecture was seen as a wild conjecture and most of my friends and colleagues their attitude was oh saskin used to be good physicist but they both lost their Marbles and I was told that more than once I think somebody actually said lost your marbles uh one of the few people who actually believed it completely Ed Whitten really okay yeah I know he has this really famous paper anti- deider space And holography yeah that was lat to though of course but uh yeah and he and I wrote a paper um uh uh on anti- space and holography which I think is a better paper much better paper uh anyway yeah Ed was a big very early proponent of the idea he was very excited by it um and that was encouraging but then when Mala wrote his paper it was clear that it was right it was you know it was not possible even though it may be totally counterintuitive he had a very concrete example which was you could do calculations you could really test out the idea so it became a principle of physics at that point but then it also became a tool for studying Quantum field theories by using the bulk by using the gravit by using The Duality between the two pictures where you use Simple ideas of what's going on in the bulk that's the three-dimensional reality to inform you about how the quantum field theory on the boundary works so it became a tool and it's certainly at the center it's probably the most important development in the quantum theory of gravity since uh Hawkings discovery of Hawking radiation it's the center of the whole story that and entanglement before we get to the world of holography and ads CFT how did the holographic principle become this huge I mean this weapon that kind of won the war the black hole War how did it connect to the black holes and then because this anti-de space which is surrounded by a boundary uh can have black holes in it these black holes can evaporate they can be created in the anti theit space they can evaporate but by simply knowing that the description of all of this could be encoded in a quantum theory on the boundary you are 100% assured that no information could be lost because the other description or two descriptions one was the black hole in the anti in the interior of the anti-de space it was would be like having a black hole at the center of your hologram okay but you know that the Hologram is actually described mathematically precisely by the boundary uh by the film at the boundary the details of it and you know that that description is quantum mechanics Quantum fuel Theory to be precise and Quantum field Theory cannot lose information so so that was the thing that broke the back of the information loss hypothesis interesting I had thought that it kind of seemed like the war was one before ads CFT because there were ways of making use of the holographic principle with string theory on the boundary of the black hole Yeah right there were ways of thinking about the black holes that way the first one was a way that I uh I I put forward which was actually just ordinary string theory on the boundary of the black hole that was successful in the in um and explaining the entropy to within a factor of four it wasn't able to get the detail quite right and then there was this wonderful paper of strominger and um uh kumin vafa K vafa that found an example where they could be totally precise about the relation between black Co entropian area so yes that that was a predecessor of it when was that that was 1990 96 I think I forgot and then there was the paper by myself and a couple of other people on what's called Matrix Theory which was kind of a forerunner of ads CFT a similar kind of thing again a holographic kind of description of something uh but um the uh the ads CFT was a lot clearer a lot clearer a lot um it wasn't more precise it had the same degree of precision but it was much easier to understand and so it captured people's um attention and properly so it capture their attention more than the uh so-called Matrix theory that who was it myself Steve Shanker Willie Fishler and Tom Banks it's called bfss now people have gotten more interested in bfss idea and it's being carried out more more consistently but but both as a matter of physics and as a matter of um what should we call it cultural uh development the ads CFT was there was a thing that um that really nailed it nailed it to the point where where Steven himself had to give up really it was ads CFT that did it for him I think so I think so I think so one one reason that that surprises me is just I've never heard of Steven described as a a string theorist and that's obviously integral to ads CFT so it surprises me that he would take it so seriously well look he wasn't a string theorist but he was very very smart he knew when he had lost cuz he tried he he tried to sort of turn it about and make it sound more like what he had said but you know he he knew he knew and uh it took him a few years after the adft but uh look we were friends I do remember that he and I and an my wife had dinner with him at his house with his daughter and um he had basically given up what I have to say about him he was delighted by the whole story by the book no no no he was delighted by the ads story he um he knew he had lost and he wasn't unhappy about it that's great yeah he was a marvelous it was something special I think that since well there are a number of reasons for this ads CFT is vital to winning the war it's I mean the huge outgrowth of the holographic principle that you and at H developed and it's just the most cited paper I think of all time now in high energy particle physics I think it might be worth talking a little bit more about it I mean you Ed some words like Duality um I I'm not sure people know what that means just it just means equivalence between two descriptions of the same thing so so what is The Duality at the heart of take the case first take the case of the Hologram there's a description of the Hologram in terms of what's going on on the film and if you were to look through a microscope at the film surrounding the Hologram what you would see is all of a bunch of little tiny scratches and random uh looking nothing that looks anything like the uh the thing that it's supposed to be encoding what does it look like it just looks like a a bunch of random scratches which are not truly random little marks on the film um on the other hand it has exactly the same information as the three-dimensional thing that it was uh that it was created from this pretty girl in the case of the Hologram that I was watching has ex it has exactly the same information at least of of her surface if not her interior um so that's a duality Duality between two descriptions one description says ears nose hair eyeball balls uh and certain shape and the other's description says tiny tiny scratches on a piece of photographic film if you knew how to analyze those scratches the right way how to do the right kinds of Foria transforms and so forth in principle you could take those tiny scratches and reconstruct what they were pictures of what they were uh Holograms of the full three-dimensional and everything else but it would be very hard be very very hard and complex to do that reconstruction so we call those dual descriptions du not dool L dual descriptions of the same thing one in terms of properties of the of the uh of the film The Other in terms of the obvious properties of the object which it's there to encode the same thing is true in the ads CFT idea the whatever ads is it's a space with a boundary it's a space that has a boundary um surrounding it and The Duality is a duality between a theory that lives on this boundary it's a Quantum field theory that lives on the boundary just like the uh the information on the Hologram lives on the on the um on the surface on the film and what takes place in the bulk or the interior of the um of the anti- space which is more like what's taking place inside the Hologram in the three-dimensional reality of the Hologram so The Duality is two different descriptions of the same thing one in terms of what's going on in the interior for that you use gravity you use general relativity use black hole physics in the three-dimensional reality inside and the other description is in terms of this very random kind of quantum field Theory description involving lots of fluctuation and lots of stuff that you would not easily recognize what it's encoding but which does encode exactly the same thing but that's what Duality means it means two different descriptions which seem very different from each other but of the of what is in principle the same thing okay just to summarize it and then I think we'll pretty much be done with the black hole War so the idea this you're going to be done with me soon yeah so this the ads CFT correspondence on the one hand you have I think it's type Tob String Theory uh describing the bulk and then you've got a conformal field theory on the boundary of the anti- Deiter space in this string theoretic description okay that's just that's just highly formalized Lang language for what I said yes but I just want to make sure that I have it clear in the bulk you have these black holes they accrete and they evaporate and because it is all captured by this equivalence on the boundary and no information is lost because it's Quantum field theoretical right that's how you win the black hole War that's how the black hole war was ultimately one okay perfect and then the final question on that is is the is this pretty much settled in the physics Community now yeah I think so look I tend to interact with a group of people who share my own views half of them are my students incidentally uh I I tend to interact with them how many people are there out there I think some of the older relativists may still be skeptical people like Bill unru uh but I may be wrong about that now I haven't seen bill for many many years Bill enu was one of the Pioneers in Hawking radiation physics um he was very very skeptical about all of this another was another was Bob Wald who was one of the true great relativists of the late 20th century he was very skeptical whether they've come around but remember that this was an older generation who were brought up on the rules of general relativity classical general relativity and um this was all very very new to them okay it was also new to the young people who invented it like me who was I don't know I'm not sure how old I uh I was in my mid-50s I think the holographic principle um and I'm probably older than both of them both UNR but nevertheless I'm young at heart so uh I consider myself one of the young people people the young people it was new to them too but young people don't have all the baggage of uh of long long life having believed one thing and then suddenly being told to believe something else so the older generation of relativists I think were skeptical and may still be skeptical people like wal and Andre I don't know but marring them I think it's completely settled I think it's completely settled earlier in our conversation you said that periodically there are these crises in physics and the black hole war is one of them it's no I wasn't thinking about the black hole I was thinking about these crisis where experiments don't seem to agree or where experiments seems to disagree with Theory an example being the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon uh uh which if you use the same physics as for the electron you get a certain number from ordinary Quantum field Theory Quantum electrodynamics in that case but if you measure it somewhere as in the 12 decimal place or something the experiment and the um and the calculation disagreed this is one example of the kind of Crisis I was talking about crises which usually have to do with discrepancies between Theory and experiment why do they happen why they why are they always there and the reason is because both Theory and experiment are always working on the edge of the technology experiment for obvious reasons they're they're very hard you don't do an experiment now in 3 weeks it's uh the better part of a scientific lifetime to do an experiment it can take 20 30 years to do an experiment they're very very hard and you're always working at the very very edge of the technology you're working at the edge of the statistical fluctuations and things and at the same time if the experiments previous to that had pushed the theory so hard that you might be working in the 12th decimal place of the uh of the theory so it's not to my mind at all surprising that a period takes place where there's a discrepancy and everybody gets very exercised about it and very worried about it and then it goes away and then it goes away okay so we're facing now a couple of these kind of crisis in cosmology right now yeah there's one that's called the Hubble tension uh the Hubble tension you know what the Hubble constant is it's the rate of expansion of the universe today uh um there are two ways of determining it one is by direct observation of objects moving away from us measuring their um velocity and their distance it's of course not so simple use Supernova and all kinds of things but uh but it's sort of direct measurement of the expansion of the universe today or at least seen from uh through te ordinary telescopes or maybe fancy telescopes okay that's that's uh that was one calculation it leads to a certain number I think it's 74 something per something per something uh kilometers per second per MEAP Parc but uh okay so that's was one measurement of the um of the Hubble expansion there was another method which you go way back to the era when the cosmic microwave radiation was being formed in the very hot plasma you can see that at a great distance away from us you have to go you want to go way back in time the way you go way back in time is going to very large distances you measure the properties of the cosmic microwave background you use it to inform you about what was going on at that time and then you use the equations of cosmology to run it from the ver remote past up till today the Freeman Roberts and Walker equations some knowledge about equations of State this that and the other things stuff having to do with something called bionic acoustic oscillations doesn't matter what it is it's using a theory about what happened 13.8 billion light years 13.8 billion years ago and then using equations to um to extrapolate it to today it disagrees with uh with that 74 it gives you 68 or something well what's the difference between 68 and 74 no big deal unless you happen to be either the group who did one experiment or the other and who are absolutely convinced that they are correct okay and uh that's what's happening now both experiments are kind of at the edge of uh technology ology nevertheless the proponents of these two numbers who are you know Wonderful physicist these are not amateurs these are not the uh these are super uh good scientists one group is absolutely certain their number is correct and the other group is absolutely certain their number is correct one resolution might be that something unknown or or unaccounted for happened in between during this time from the microwave radiation to today it's possible but that's a crisis now will that crisis go away will uh or will some new physics come in between no no I I always guess doesn't matter what it is when a crisis like this happens I always guess it's going to go away and I've almost always been right why do you say almost what's the exception trying to remember um yeah uh very early on I I do remember very early on Jim Peebles was claiming that there was some evidence for something like dark energy for something like a cosmological constant or a little bit different perhaps this was long ago and he was quoting data um I thought that seemed very unlikely to me that there was a a cosmological constant that seemed uh and I was pretty sure that his data was probably uh well no his data was right there was a cosmological constant I was wrong about that one okay that's funny yeah well as far as I can remember I think it's the only one I was wrong about not because I'm such a genius but because I always say it's going to go away the last thing I want to ask you today brings the black hole War some of the things we've been talking about into the present I just interviewed your colleague Rafael buso who I know is one of your students and he was not one of my students one of my post talks here yeah he was a student of Stevens Hawkings okay interesting I assume that if somebody's your postto they're your student but I guess some sense I but the young people I've worked with I've learned as much from them as they did from me but he's very much working on holography and I know that many many physicists are it is extremely vital and robust today yes and what I wanted to ask you about is what the state is both of holography and M Theory today as you see them well what is M Theory um um M Theory is a particular example of one of the many possible uh things that string theory can do it can M Theory is some limit of some particular string theory in which it goes and becomes an 11-dimensional gravitational Theory it's not thought to be the theory of the world it's not anymore I mean I think it was well it's not 11 dimensional uh I I'm not sure where this idea that M Theory was there's just a whole bunch of different corners of the parameter space uh which describe different kinds of let's call them universes that the and they have different dimensionality they have different properties and M Theory I think was originally intended to be some corner where the physics was flat 11 di was 11 dimensional physics [Music] um why that was seen as somehow uh um a better Theory of Everything than any of the other Corners it was not a good theory of the real world real world is just not 11 dimensional um one thing that did happen with what is called M Theory is it was the first example in which there was a complete Quantum description holographic Quantum description uh of that particular theory of that particular um and that was this bfss matrix model which but there was nothing particularly uh um what should I say nothing it was not a theory of the real world neither was anti-de space right it was just one corner of the of the parameter space yeah my my impression was that it was believed that all of the different string theories type one 2 I2 these were all limits of M Theory and m the m theory was also a limit of them uh they could all be represented as what we would call compactifications of this 11 dimensional Theory and that's true but the 11 dimensional Theory itself can just be thought of as a limit of any one of these and some unusual range of parameters so uh I don't see anything more fundamental about it than any of the others then maybe the the question that I should ask is in addition to continued work on holography ads CFT and its offshoots are higher high energy particle physicist and string theorists still working on string theory at or its offshoots as a final theory of the world okay I have a view of that which my colleagues you may have seen it on other interviews I will say what it is here I have a view of it which is probably uh a little different than most of my colleagues although by now they might uh they might have the same view my view of it goes something like this so there's this very precise mathematical structure it includes M Theory it includes type 2B type 2 a and so forth and they're all exactly super symmetric and the super symmetry is absolutely essential to their stability to their rigor to their mathematical existence let's call it there is absolutely no doubt whatever that that is not the theory of the real world the real world is just not not super symmetric some of these people say oh okay but we'll spontaneously break super symmetry nobody has ever been able to do that that has never been able to be uh so the the the real string theory that people know and understand and that the mathematicians consider uh and not just the mathematicians the mathematical physicists like myself uh consider uh precise that is not the theory of the real world it is definitely not the real world is not super symmetric okay so what do people mean when they say string theory and let's call it String Theory with a small s now they mean something that's inspired by the uh by the precise Theory something which goes beyond it something with bigger boundaries and we just don't know what that thing is we simply do not know what generalization of string of super symmetric string theories are possible we do not know nobody knows there nevertheless that's the idea that there's some expansion of the boundaries of what string theory is beyond this capital s Theory to a uh to what I call small s String Theory or string inspired Theory or um that nobody has ever defined I incidentally I'm a Believer in this to uh and that the real world is outside the edges of what we call capital S String Theory but in some range of theories which is inspired maybe even has strings but all kinds of theories have strings in them incidentally superconductors have strings in them my shoelaces have strings in them all kinds of things have strings in them and not all string theories have strings so whether a theory has strings in it or not is not the criteria for whether it's String Theory uh spaghetti has strings okay so my view of it is we don't know how the real world is connected to this very precise String Theory so what is the value of then of the precise Theory well first of all perhaps it will um Inspire uh a generalization it may but if nothing else it has taught us with certainty that quantum mechanics and gravity can coexist that all of these paradoxes like Steven's Paradox and the Paradox of Infinities and all that stuff that uh that tell you that quantum mechanics and gravity cannot coexist they were all wrong that we know with certainty now because of capital S string theory that quantum mechanics and gravity do coexist and can coexist that's been the main output from it uh and the um the attempts at turning it into or let's put this the let's say deriving the standard model of particles from it that's been largely failure uh not total failure it is true that some of these theories look a good deal like the standard model but they uh they're not they're not so um that doesn't mean that we should get rid of string theory as a theory of the world it means we should just be honest with ourselves and uh not not be content with something that doesn't work and not tell the media incidentally most of my friends who string theorists don't go around uh um uh prizing for it in the media and so forth that they don't but somehow um and because of this unfortunately in some broader segment of the public and that includes physicists it's been interpreted that string theory is a failure that's not correct string theory is a structure a mathematical structure which has taught us all kinds of things about gravity and quantum mechanics and how they can coexist but it has not been able it has not been able to confront the real non-supersymmetric world yet and maybe never uh could it be that it's totally wrong and it's completely wrongheaded and the real theory of the real world has nothing whatever to do with string theory yes it could be I rather doubt it I don't think so I think it get close enough that you should we should continue to look uh for how it can be expanded but um you know I'm 84 years old I have I also have the baggage of uh my first contact with string theory was 1969 and uh as one of the so-called fathers of the subject I have a proprietary interest in it so you shouldn't take for me if I say that uh that I think maybe it can work in some expanded form but I also think the Skeptics are almost are way off base in what they say so you you say this capital S string theory is not the right Theory but lowercase s String Theory something String Theory inspired is what you believe to be on track now this Theory may or may not have strings but one thing that is well I think it does have strings but you think it does have strings yeah I do but um incidentally M Theory as this 11 dimensional Theory does not brain right as brains the question that I have though is you said that our world is not 11 dimensional and that's why that's one reason why M Theory isn't the the I don't worry about that as much as I worry about the need for super symmetry but when I say when you say it's String Theory inspired one of the biggest things that people know about string theory is that there are these compactified small Dimensions around which strings fine why so you think that there still might be these extra curled up Dimensions yeah okay then what is it about 11 that is special versus 10 oh boy no it's nothing that's particularly special about 11 versus 10 it's more important question is what's special about 10 and 11 but especially what's what's special about 11 it's a highly technical thing uh 11 dimensions are simply the largest dimension in which you can form which you can formulate relativistically covariant super symmetric theories it's it's just you cannot push it past 11 that does not sound like a terribly good reason for uh uh but nevertheless uh it is the limiting number of Dimensions the biggest number of dimensions in which these theories can be formulated technical reasons they're very technical and I I not even sure I could uh tell you what they are it's the largest number of dimensions in which a theory can be super symmetric a relativistic theory uh bunch of little bits of algebra you put together and out comes the number 11 um so from a technical mathematical super symmetric point of view it seems to be special and in this same vein I mentioned rapael buso earlier and I believe this was a conversation that I had with Raphael but it wasn't on camera where we were talking about super Symmetry and the fact that um super Partners haven't been found at certain in large headon collider and I believe but even if they had been found the world is not super symmetric it's not super symmetric because the super Partners don't have the same mass as their other half and that's enough to ruin capital S String Theory even had they been found really so that suggests to me then that you've been pretty confident that the world is not super symmetric for a very long time oh yeah yeah yeah however I would have said had Super Sub Partners been discovered I would have said that's very good for the idea of small s String Theory I see okay very interesting and then the last thing I mean going back to ads CFT again ads CFT is built on type 2B super symmetric String Theory one version of it yes one version of it I always get what's type two and type two type three type four type 7even I no I know what they are but I have to remind myself and the B and the a but this is a a super symmetric theory in the world is not super symetrical you also said that the world is not ads space both of those things are true is it the world is definitely not anti- space uh and the uh the precise versions the state versions the versions that actually make sense of um of the ads CFT are all super symmetric is there work going into creating a version of ads CFT that might better match our space and be perhaps a more concrete way I don't think there's any way that that our space time can be inti de space Oh I'm saying like a A dscf or something like that that might okay actually be our world yes um is there work going on that's been my focus for the last five years for sure dsft not dsft that's a particular version of of how um but holographic description of the Horizon of the C of space very much so that's very much and um one particular example of it uh doesn't matter what it is it's a mathematical example of it but uh yes there is some motion in that direction now and it's going it's going to get bigger what do you mean it's going to get bigger no no I mean what I mean by get I don't mean that the space is going to get bigger I mean that the number of people the activity in it will get bigger and it will get very big working on a holographic theory that could represent our describe our world well no I I think that's still premature I don't think when of that um working on a holographic theory that can describe the sitter space our world is not really the C of space it um it's tending toward the C of space with time um this the degree to which it is really Eternal the c space that's not completely known but probably not um the world seems to be evolving towards something that looks very much like the C of space whether it'll be eternally stable after that we don't know uh but uh one can try to describe a mathematically precise Eternal exact form of the CIT space which again wouldn't be our world exactly but it would be a lot closer so you can forget all of that yes our world is more like the c space much more like the c space and um it uh has it has scared people I mean I don't mean it's scared the we live in the c space yeah I mean that the lack of a boundary the lack of um super symmetry the lack of all the things that made it possible to be very precise about anti-de space has scared people away from thinking about the c space I thought I talk to young people all the time and I say why aren't you thinking about the c space Oh I won't be able to get a job that's not a good reason I thought that de space had a boundary it was just Tim likee rather than no I mean a spatial boundary uh a boundary of the same kind the boundary of the of anti-de space would be said to be timelike it contains One Direction which is time the bound the corresponding boundary of the c space is space like different kind of animal not amendable to a holographic description not the right thing for a holographic description uh so people invented something called dscf which I'm not a a fan of I I I don't think it's the right idea but whatever the right idea is there are very few people working to toward this now I would guess there's going to be I would hope that there's going to be an explosion of activity and it last question you said that our world is tending toward DS CFT with time it's getting more and more that was what I told you before that all the galaxies are going to go out past the Horizon our space is going to become empty to c space except for our own Galaxy which we happen to be sitting on but does that mean then that you don't think that our world is one that has a space-like boundary I do yeah that's what I think well okay it's a different kind of boundary it's a horizon instead of a cold boundary of the kind that anti-de space has our world meaning the world that we can see by any kind of experiment is bounded by a horizon that Horizon is a kind of boundary of our world um but it's not the same kind of boundary as antient space so it requires some new ideas and and um and it requires tell you the truth I don't know why more people AR working on it they should be I talked to a lot of young people as I said and I asked them and they're just afraid of it they're afraid of it because the ideas aren't there they don't know what to how to think about it and um and they're afraid they won't be able to get a job if they are not that there's a prejudice against it there's no prejudice against it but they just won't be able to write paper yeah well this has been a marathon session thank you so much this has been so absolutely excellent I love the black hole War I hope our our listeners check it out yeah okay thank you [Music]
