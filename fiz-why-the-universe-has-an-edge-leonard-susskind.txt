Let me tell you something that might sound crazy. The universe has an edge. Not the observable universe. That's obvious.

We can only see so far because light has only had so much time to reach us since the Big Bang. I'm talking about something deeper, something more fundamental. The universe itself might have a boundary, an edge beyond which there was nothing, not even space. Now, before you think I've lost my mind, let me explain what I mean and why I think this might actually be true.

For most of my career, I assumed the universe was infinite. That seemed like the simplest assumption. Space just goes on forever in all directions. No edge, no boundary, no center, just infinite space filled with galaxies and matter stretching out to infinity.

That's what most cosmologists assumed, too. But the holographic principle changed everything for me and it should change how we think about the universe having uh having edges or boundaries. Here's the thing about the holographic principle. It says that all the information in a volume of space can be encoded on the boundary of that volume.

For a black hole, everything inside is encoded on the two-dimensional horizon. The three-dimensional interior is in some sense redundant. it emerges from the information on the boundary. Now, if that's true for black holes, what about the entire universe?

Does our universe have a boundary, too? And if it does, is all the information about our three-dimensional universe encoded on some distant two-dimensional surface? This is where things get really interesting. Our universe is expanding, and not just expanding, but accelerating.

There's dark energy pushing everything apart faster and faster. And this creates something called a cosmological horizon. A boundary beyond which we can never see no matter how long we wait. Light from beyond that horizon will never reach us because space is expanding too fast.

That horizon is in a very real sense an edge to our observable universe. And it's not just a an observational limitation. It's a fundamental boundary. Here's where it gets weird.

According to the holographic principle, all the information about everything inside our cosmological horizon, everything in our observable universe is encoded on that horizon itself. The horizon is like a holographic screen and we're living inside the hologram. The three-dimensional space we experience, the volume of the universe we inhabit, emerges from information encoded on a two-dimensional surface at the edge of the universe. That edge is real.

It's fundamental. And everything we are, everything we experience is a projection from that boundary. Now, you might ask, what's beyond the edge? What's on the other side of the cosmological horizon?

And that's where things get philosophically tricky. From our perspective, there is no beyond. We can never access it. We can never see it.

We can never interact with it. In a very real sense, for us, it doesn't exist. But here's the deeper point. If the holographic principle is right, then the edge, the boundary is where the fundamental physics lives.

The interior, the bulk space where we think we live is emergent. It's derived from the boundary. So the edge is more fundamental than the interior. This flips our usual intuition on its head.

We think of ourselves as living in the main volume of the universe. And the edge, if there is one, as some distant, irrelevant boundary. But actually the edge is where the action is. The edge is where the real degrees of freedom live.

We're just a holographic projection. Let me give you another reason to think the universe has an edge. It has to do with entropy and information. There's a famous result called the Beckenstein bound that says the maximum amount of information that can be stored in a region of space is proportional to the area of its boundary, not its volume.

For a black hole, the maximum entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon. That's why black holes have such enormous entropy. Their horizon is huge. So they can store a massive amount of information.

Now apply this to the whole universe. If our universe has a cosmological horizon, then the maximum amount of information in our universe is proportional to the area of that horizon. It's finite. The universe or at least our observable patch of it can only contain a finite amount of information.

This means the universe has an edge in information space. There's a limit to how much can happen, how many distinct quantum states the universe can be in. And that limit is set by the area of the boundary, the cosmological horizon. So the edge isn't just a spatial boundary.

It's an information boundary. And information is what's really fundamental. Now let's talk about what this edge looks like from different perspectives. From our perspective, inside the universe, the cosmological horizon is far away, receding as space expands.

We can never reach it. It's always at the edge of what we can observe. But imagine you could somehow be an observer at the boundary, sitting on the cosmological horizon itself. What would you see?

Well, according to the holographic principle, you'd see all the information about the interior universe encoded in the two-dimensional physics at the horizon. You wouldn't see three-dimensional space. You'd see a two-dimensional theory, quantum fields living on a two-dimensional surface. And from those fields, from their entanglement and dynamics, the three-dimensional interior would emerge.

This is exactly what happens in the ads CFT correspondence. The boundary theory is two-dimensional, lower than the bulk, has no gravity, just quantum field theory, and the bulk spaceime emerges from it. Our universe might work the same way. But here's a puzzle.

If we're living in a hologram projected from the cosmological horizon, why does it feel so three-dimensional? Why do we experience depth, volume, a third dimension of space? The answer is emergence. At the fundamental level on the boundary there are just two dimensions.

But when you have the right kind of entanglement between degrees of freedom on that boundary when the quantum state is organized in the right way a third dimension emerges. It's not really there. It's a useful description a way of organizing the information. But from our perspective embedded in that information it feels completely real.

We experience three dimensions because that's the emergent description that makes sense for observers like us. This is similar to how time emerges. At the fundamental level, there might be no time, just a timeless quantum state. But when you coar grain, when you look at correlations within that state, time appears.

Same with the third dimension of space. It's emergent, not fundamental. Now, let me address uh a common objection. Uh people say if the universe has an edge, what's beyond it?

What's outside? And in our usual way of thinking, that's a natural question. Every boundary we know has two sides. The edge of a table has the table on one side and air on the other.

But the cosmological horizon isn't like that. There's no outside. Or rather, the question of what's outside doesn't make sense. The boundary defines the universe.

There's nothing beyond it. Not because there's a wall or a barrier, but because beyond isn't a meaningful concept. It's like asking what's north of the north pole. The question assumes a framework that breaks down at the boundary.

At the north pole, the direction north becomes undefined. Similarly, at the cosmological horizon, the concept of beyond becomes undefined. The edge of the universe is not in space. It's the edge of space itself.

Space ends there, not because there's something stopping it, but because the degrees of freedom that give rise to space don't extend beyond that boundary. Here's another way to think about it. The universe is a quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom determined by the area of the cosmological horizon. Those degrees of freedom are all that exists.

They define the system. Asking what's beyond the system is like asking what's beyond all that exists. It's a category error. The system is complete in itself.

The boundary is where it ends. Not because there's something else beyond, but because there isn't. Now, I want to talk about how this connects to the big bang and the beginning of the universe. If the universe has an edge in space, does it have an edge in time too?

Did time begin at the big bang? In the traditional picture, yes. Time starts at the big bang and the singularity there is the edge of time. You can't go back further.

But we know that picture breaks down at the singularity. Our equations give infinite density, infinite curvature. Something's wrong. If spacetime is emergent, then maybe the big bang singularity isn't real.

Maybe it's just uh where our emergent description breaks down. At the fundamental level, at the level of quantum information on the boundary, there might be no singularity, just a quantum state. And from that state, the big bang emerges for observers like us. So time might have an edge in the emergent description, but not at the fundamental level.

The fundamental quantum state might be timeless, and time emerges along with space from the holographic boundary. This would mean the universe has edges in both space and time in the emergent description. But at the fundamental level on the holographic boundary, those edges dissolve into something more subtle. The boundary itself might be timeless and lower dimensional and from it our four-dimensional space time with its edges emerges.

Let me tell you why I find this picture beautiful. It unifies several deep ideas in physics. the holographic principle, the emergence of spaceime, the finite uh information content of the universe, the role of boundaries, they all fit together into a coherent picture and it resolves paradoxes. The information paradox for black holes gets resolved because information is never truly inside the black hole.

It's always on the horizon. Similarly, information in the universe is never truly in the bulk. it's on the cosmological horizon. The measurement problem in quantum mechanics might get resolved too.

If observers are emergent structures in the holographic description, then measurement is just the process by which information gets organized into classical looking patterns in the bulk. The boundary state evolves unitarily preserving all information and measurement emerges in the bulk description. Now, is this picture definitely right? No, we don't have a complete theory yet.

We don't know exactly how to apply holography to our universe with its positive cosmological constant. Add SCFT works for anti-deitter space which has a negative cosmological constant. Our universe has positive cosmological constant. So it's ditter space and a holographic description is uh is less well understood.

But we're making progress. There are proposals for ditter holography for how to think about the cosmological horizon holographically. It's an active area of research and um I'm optimistic we'll figure it out. What we do know is that the universe has a cosmological horizon, a boundary we can never cross.

And we know that holography works for black holes and for ad space. It's not a big leap to think it works for the whole universe, too. And if it does, then the universe has an edge, a fundamental boundary at the cosmological horizon where all the information about the universe is encoded. We're living inside that boundary in the holographic projection, experiencing an emergent three-dimensional space with emergent time.

The edge is real. It's fundamental. And it's where the deep physics lives. Everything we experience, everything we are is a consequence of the quantum information encoded on that distant boundary.

So when I say the universe has an edge, I don't mean there's a wall out there where space stops. I mean there's a fundamental boundary, a holographic screen from which our entire reality emerges. That boundary is the edge of existence itself. And that changes everything.

It changes how we think about cosmology, about the nature of space and time, about what's real and what's emergent. It's a profound shift in our understanding of the universe. I've spent decades thinking about this, working through the mathematics, arguing with colleagues, trying to understand what it all means. And the more I learn, the more convinced I become that the holographic principle is right, that spaceime is emergent, and that the universe has an edge.

Not everyone agrees with me. Some physicists think the universe is infinite, that there's no fundamental boundary, that holography is just a curiosity that applies to special cases like black holes. Maybe they're right. Science is about debate, about testing ideas, about following the evidence.

But the evidence to me points toward holography, toward emergence, uh toward the universe having a boundary. The mathematics is too beautiful, the connections too deep, the resolutions of paradoxes too elegant for it to be a coincidence. So that's why I believe the universe has an edge. Not because I want it to, not because it makes me comfortable, but because that's where the physics is leading.

And I'm excited to see where it goes from here. We're on the verge of understanding something profound about the nature of reality. And the edge of the universe is part of that understanding.
