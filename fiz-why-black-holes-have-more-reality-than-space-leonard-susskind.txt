Black holes have more reality than space. This sounds backwards, doesn't it? We think of space as the fundamental arena of reality and black holes as exotic objects within that space. But it's the opposite.

Black holes are more real, more fundamental, closer to the true nature of reality than the space they seem to exist in. I'm Leonard Suskinand and after decades of studying black holes, quantum mechanics, and the holographic principle, I've come to realize that black holes are not just objects in space. They're windows into the fundamental structure of reality. They're more real than the space around them because they reveal what reality actually is.

Quantum information on surfaces. Let me tell you why black holes have more reality than space and what this tells us about the nature of existence itself. When I say black holes have more reality than space, I need to explain what I mean by reality. I'm not talking about which seems more tangible to our senses.

I'm talking about what's fundamental versus what's emergent. what's at the bottom of the hierarchy of physical description versus what deres from something deeper. Space is emergent. It arises from quantum information, from entanglement patterns, from microscopic degrees of freedom we don't fully understand.

Space is like temperature, real at the macroscopic level, but not fundamental, deriving from something more basic. Black holes, specifically their horizons, are where the fundamental degrees of freedom actually live. The horizon is not emergent. It's where reality is encoded.

Black holes are closer to fundamental reality than space itself. Black holes have more reality because they're less emergent, closer to the fundamental structure. Let me tell you how I came to this understanding. It started with the Beckinstein Hawking entropy.

In the 1970s, Jacob Beckinstein and Steven Hawking discovered that black holes have entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon. At first, this seemed like a curiosity, but I realized it was profound. Entropy measures information, the number of microates. For a black hole, the entropy being proportional to area means the microates, the fundamental degrees of freedom live on the two-dimensional horizon, not in the three-dimensional interior.

On the surface, the horizon is where the physics is really happening, where the fundamental information is stored. This told me that the horizon is more fundamental than the interior space. The interior can be derived from the horizon but not vice versa. The horizon has priority, has more reality.

The horizon of a black hole is more real than the interior space because that's where the fundamental degrees of freedom actually live. Now, let me contrast this with uh ordinary space. When we look at empty space, we think there's nothing there. Just a vacuum, a stage waiting for matter to appear on it.

But quantum field theory tells us the vacuum is full of fluctuating fields, virtual particles, quantum activity. And holography tells us that even this quantum vacuum structure is emergent derived from information on boundaries. Space itself, even empty space is an emergent phenomenon. It's not fundamental.

It arises from something deeper. Quantum information, entanglement, degrees of freedom that don't themselves live in space. Black holes are different. Their horizons are where these fundamental degrees of freedom are manifest.

The horizon is not emergent from something else. It's where the foundation of reality is exposed. Space is emergent scaffolding. Black hole horizons are the real structure that scaffolding hangs from.

Let me tell you about the information paradox and how it reveals this hierarchy of reality. When something falls into a black hole, where does the information go? If you think of space as fundamental, the answer seems obvious. The information falls into the interior space, gets trapped there, and disappears when the black hole evaporates.

This leads to the paradox, information seems destroyed, violating quantum mechanics. But if you recognize that the horizon is more real than the interior space, the answer is different. The information never leaves the horizon. It spreads across the horizon surface, gets encoded in the horizon degrees of freedom, and eventually comes back out in the Hawking radiation.

The interior space was never the real repository of information. The horizon always was. We just didn't realize it because we were thinking of space as more fundamental than it is. The information paradox is resolved by recognizing that horizons are more real than interior space.

Now let me explain black hole complimentarity in this context. Complimentarity says you can describe black hole physics either from the outside in terms of horizon degrees of freedom or from the inside in terms of interior geometry. But these aren't equally fundamental descriptions. The horizon description is fundamental.

The interior description is derived emergent a holographic projection from the horizon. An observer falling through the horizon experiences interior space. Experiences falling toward the singularity. This experience is genuine, but it's emergent.

What's fundamentally happening is that their quantum state is getting entangled with the horizon degrees of freedom. The interior experience is the subjective perception of this entanglement process. The horizon process is what's objectively real. Think of it like a video game.

The player experiences a three-dimensional world and that experience is genuine. But what's really happening is code execution, information processing. The experienced world is emergent from the underlying computation. Black hole horizons are the underlying computation.

Interior space is the emergent experience. The horizon has more reality. Let me tell you about the holographic principle and how it establishes this hierarchy. The holographic principle says that all information in a volume can be encoded on its boundary.

This isn't symmetric. You can derive the interior from the boundary but not vice versa. The boundary is logically prior more fundamental. The interior is derived less fundamental.

For black holes, this is explicit. The horizon is the boundary. The interior is derivable from horizon information. The horizon is more real.

And the holographic principle suggests this is universal. Every region of space has a boundary that's more real than the interior. Space everywhere is emergent from boundaries, from surfaces where the real degrees of freedom live. Black holes make this obvious because their horizons are dramatic, observably significant surfaces.

But the principle applies everywhere. Boundaries are always more real than interiors. Now, let me address what the horizon actually is. In classical general relativity, the horizon is just a surface in spaceime, the boundary where escape velocity equals the speed of light.

Nothing special physically happens there. But quantum mechanically, the horizon is alive with degrees of freedom. There are quantum bits of information, microates, the things that give the black hole its entropy. These are real physical entities, not just mathematical surfaces.

What are they? We don't know the complete answer. In string theory, they might be strings at the stretched horizon. In loop quantum gravity, they might be quantum geometry degrees of freedom.

In other approaches, they might be something else, but whatever they are, they're real. They're the stuff reality is made of at the fundamental level. They're more real in the space they bound because space emerges from them. The horizon degrees of freedom are the atoms of reality.

Space is what emerges when you have many of these atoms properly organized. Let me tell you about ads CFT and how it proves this hierarchy of reality. The ADS CFT correspondence shows that a gravitational theory in a higher dimensional space is exactly equivalent to a quantum field theory on the lower dimensional boundary. The boundary theory is where the fundamental description lives.

It has quantum fields but no extra spatial dimension, no bulk interior. The bulk space emerges from entanglement patterns in the boundary fields. In this correspondence, you can have black holes in the bulk. But in the fundamental boundary description, there are no black holes, just thermal states of the boundary fields.

The black hole horizon in the bulk corresponds to a thermal region on the boundary. Which is more real? The boundary thermal state or the bulk black hole? The boundary is fundamental.

The bulk black hole is emergent. But here's the key insight. Even though the bulk is emergent, the horizon is where the bulk makes contact with the fundamental reality. The horizon is the interface between the emergent bulk and the real boundary.

Horizons are more real than bulk space because they're closer to the fundamental boundary where reality actually lives. Now, let me address how this relates to entropy and thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of information of how many microates correspond to a macro state. For ordinary matter, entropy scales with volume.

More volume means more ways to arrange molecules. More microates, more entropy. But for black holes, entropy scales with area. This is telling us something profound.

The microates don't fill the volume. They live on the surface. The horizon is where the information is, where the uh the real physical degrees of freedom are. Space has emergent entropy, the entropy of things arranged in space.

Horizons have fundamental entropy, the entropy of the degrees of freedom that constitute reality. Horizons are thermodynamically more fundamental than space. They have intrinsic entropy that doesn't depend on what's in the space that comes from their own degrees of freedom. Let me tell you about the stretched horizon.

A concept that makes this even more concrete. When you account for quantum effects, the horizon is not a razor thin surface. It has thickness, a quantum fuzz at the plank scale. This stretched horizon region is where the horizon degrees of freedom live.

It's a thin shell around the black hole where the real physics happens. Inside the stretched horizon, the interior space is emergent, holographic. Outside, space is also emergent, but in a different way. The stretched horizon is the most real part of a black hole.

It's where fundamental degrees of freedom are concentrated, where quantum information is stored, where the boundary between inside and outside is actually negotiated at the quantum level. Space is what you get when you zoom out from the stretched horizon. But zoom in, get close to fundamental scales, and the horizon is what's real. Space is the approximation.

Now, let me address singularities and why horizons are more real than them, too. In classical general relativity, a black hole has a singularity at the center, where space-time curvature becomes infinite, where the theory breaks down. Is the singularity real? No.

It's where our emergent space-time description fails completely. At the fundamental level described by the horizon degrees of freedom, there probably is no singularity. It's an artifact of taking the emergent description too seriously. The horizon is real.

It has fundamental degrees of freedom. The singularity is not real. It's where the emergent interior description breaks down. This is another way horizons are more real than space.

Space and its geometry can be pathological, can break down. Horizons remain well-defined, encoding the fundamental information. Let me tell you about ER equals EPR and how it reveals the primacy of horizons. This is the idea Juan Muldosina and I proposed.

Quantum entanglement and wormholes are the same thing. When two black holes are entangled, there's a wormhole connecting them. The wormhole is the geometric manifestation of entanglement. But what's more fundamental?

The entanglement of the wormhole. The entanglement is more fundamental. It's a relationship between horizon degrees of freedom. The wormhole, the geometric connection through space is emergent.

It's how entanglement manifests in the emergent spatial description. This means horizons and their quantum states are more real than the space-time geometry connecting them. Geometry is derived from quantum correlations between horizons. Black hole horizons are quantum mechanically correlated and these correlations are more real than the spaceime that appears to connect them.

Now, let me address what this means for observers. When you fall into a black hole, you experience crossing the horizon, falling through interior space, approaching the singularity. Is your experience less real? No.

your experience is genuine. But uh what's fundamentally happening is that your quantum state is becoming entangled with the horizon degrees of freedom in a specific way that you interpret as falling through space. The space you experience is real as an emergent phenomenon, but it's generated by your interaction with the horizon degrees of freedom, which are more fundamental. You're experiencing a subjective projection from objective horizon physics.

The horizon is more real than your experience of interior space, but your experience is genuine within the emergent framework. Let me tell you about how this resolves the firewall paradox. The firewall paradox suggested there might be high energy radiation at the horizon that destroys anything trying to fall in. This seemed to threaten the equivalence principle, the idea that you shouldn't notice anything special at the horizon as you fall through.

But the resolution is that the horizon degrees of freedom properly understood with entanglement and ER equals EPR don't create a firewall. Instead, they create the smooth interior experience through quantum correlations. The horizon is real and active quantum mechanically processing information, but this creates smooth emergence, not a firewall. The horizon's reality is compatible with the interior's emergent smoothness.

Horizons are more real than interior space, but they generate interior space as a consistent emergent structure, not as a pathological firewall. Now, let me address what makes something more real in physics. This is philosophical, but there's a clear hierarchy in how physicists think about fundamental versus emergent. Fundamental means doesn't derive from anything else, exists at the bottom of the explanatory chain, is what other things are made of or emerge from.

Emergent means derives from something more basic, arises through collective behavior or coarse graining, is valid at certain scales, but not at the deepest level. Temperature is emerging from molecular motion. Pressure is emerging from molecular collisions. These are real, measurable, useful.

But molecules are more fundamental, more real in the explanatory hierarchy. Similarly, space is emergent from quantum information on boundaries. Horizons are where those boundaries are manifest. Horizons are more fundamental, more real in the hierarchy.

Black holes through their horizons are closer to the bottom of the explanatory chain than the space they exist in. Let me tell you about quantum error correction and how it reinforces this. Recent work has shown that the emergence of bulk space from boundary theories has the mathematical structure of quantum error correction. In quantum error correction, you encode logical information in physical cubits in such a way that uh errors can be detected and corrected.

The encoding is redundant. The logical information is spread across the physical cubits. Bulk space is like the logical information. Boundary degrees of freedom are like the physical cubits.

The bulk is encoded redundantly in the boundary. And this redundancy is what allows smooth geometric emergence. But the boundary is what's real. The bulk is the encoded information, the error corrected message.

The message seems real to observers within it, but the encoding is what's fundamental. Horizons are part of the encoding structure. Space is what's encoded. The encoder is more real than the message.

Now, let me address cosmology and cosmic horizons. Our universe has a cosmological horizon due to accelerating expansion. Beyond this horizon, we can never see, never interact with, never access information from. Is this horizon real, more real than the space inside it?

I believe yes. Our entire observable universe might be a holographic projection from information on the cosmological horizon. Everything we observe, all the galaxies and stars and planets might be emergent from quantum degrees of freedom on that distant surface. The horizon is more real than the cosmic interior.

Just as a black hole horizon is more real than its interior. We're living in a hologram projected from the cosmic horizon. The horizon is the real reality. The interior space we think we inhabit is emergent.

Let me tell you about why this matters for quantum gravity. If we want to understand quantum gravity, we need to quantize what's really fundamental, not what's emergent. Traditional approaches try to quantize space-time geometry treating space as fundamental. But if space is emergent, this is the wrong approach.

You don't quantize temperature, you quantize molecules. Similarly, you shouldn't quantize space. You should quantize horizon degrees of freedom, boundary information, whatever the fundamental entities are. Space emerges quantum mechanically from these black holes point us in the right direction by showing that horizons are more fundamental than space.

Quantum gravity should be about quantum horizons not quantum space. Now let me address the measurement problem in quantum mechanics from this perspective. The measurement problem is why does measurement produce definite outcomes when quantum mechanics predicts superp positions? Maybe because measurement happens at boundaries, at horizons, where quantum information meets the classical world.

Horizons are interfaces between quantum and classical, between fundamental and emergent. When quantum information crosses a horizon, either by falling into a black hole or by becoming observable to us across our cosmological horizon, it transitions from quantum to classical. Measurement is this boundary crossing process. Horizons are more real than space and they're also more real than the classical world.

They're where quantum becomes classical, where fundamental becomes emergent. Let me tell you about consciousness and subjective experience in this framework. If you're an emergent structure in emerging space and horizons are more fundamental, what does this say about consciousness? Consciousness is emergent like space.

It arises from complex information processing, from patterns that perceive themselves. But the substrate of consciousness, the quantum information, the degrees of freedom might ultimately live on boundaries. You experience yourself as existing in space, as having spatial extension, but fundamentally you might be information on boundaries, and your spatial experience is the emergent holographic projection. Horizons are more real than your conscious experience of space, but your consciousness is still genuine within the emergent level where it exists.

Now, let me bring this together with a thought experiment. Imagine you're far from a black hole in what seems like normal space. Then you approach the black hole, cross the horizon, experience the interior. At every point, space seems real to you.

The space far from the hole, the space at the horizon, the space inside. It all seems equally substantial, equally real. But fundamentally there's a hierarchy. The horizon is most real.

It has the fundamental degrees of freedom. The far space is emergent. It's a holographic projection from distant boundaries. The interior space is doubly emergent.

It's a holographic projection from the horizon, which itself is a boundary. Black holes reveal this hierarchy. They show us that horizons are special, more fundamental than the space they bound. Let me tell you about why physicists initially resisted this idea.

We're trained to think of space as fundamental, as the arena where physics happens. The idea that space is emergent, that boundaries are more fundamental, is counterintuitive. When Gerard Huft and I first proposed holography, many physicists were skeptical. It seemed too radical, too weird.

space not being fundamental, one dimension being redundant, it violated basic intuitions, but black holes forced the conclusion on us. Their entropy, their information paradox, their horizons, everything pointed to holography to horizons being more fundamental than interior space. And ads CFT proved it could work, showing explicitly how space emerges from non-spatial physics. Now the holographic principle is mainstream at least in string theory and quantum gravity circles.

We've accepted that black holes have more reality than space. Now let me address what this means for the nature of existence. If horizons are more fundamental than space, what does existence mean? At the deepest level, to exist means to be information on a boundary, to be a degree of freedom on a horizon, contributing to its entropy, participating in its quantum evolution.

Space, matter, energy, all the things we think of as existing, these are patterns in how boundary information is organized. They exist, but derivatively, emergently. Black holes exist most fundamentally because their horizons are boundaries where fundamental information lives. Space exists less fundamentally because it's the projection from those boundaries.

Existence has levels a hierarchy from fundamental to emergent. Black holes are closer to fundamental existence. Let me tell you about the future of this research. We're still working out the details of holography for our universe.

They sit there holography. We're exploring how exactly space emerges from entanglement. We're trying to identify the fundamental degrees of freedom. But the basic picture is clear.

Black holes have revealed that horizons are more fundamental than space. They've shown us the hierarchy of reality from fundamental boundary information to emergent spatial projection. The next decades of research will flesh out this picture, make it more precise, extend it to cosmology, connect it to particle physics. But the revolution has already happened.

Black holes have already shown us that the reality is not what we thought, that space is not fundamental, that the horizons are where the real action is. Now, let me bring this all together. Black holes have more reality than space. Because their horizons are where fundamental degrees of freedom live, where quantum information is stored at the most basic level.

Space is emergent, a holographic projection from boundaries. Black hole horizons are those boundaries made manifest, observable, dramatic. The interior of a black hole is emergent from its horizon. Far space is emergent from distant boundaries.

Horizons are the interfaces. the surfaces where fundamental meets emergent. This is proven by black hole entropy scaling with area by holography by adds divided by CFT by ER equals EPR by quantum error correction structure by resolution of information paradoxes. Black holes are not exotic objects in space.

They're windows into the fundamental structure of reality, showing us that reality lives on surfaces and space is the projection from those surfaces. I've dedicated my career to understanding this, arguing with Hawking about information, developing holography, exploring ADS, CT CFT, and the conclusion is inescapable. Black holes have more reality than space. This changes everything.

how we think about quantum gravity, about cosmology, about the nature of existence itself. Space is not the fundamental arena. Boundaries are fundamental and space is what emerges from them. Black holes prove this by being undeniably real, observationally significant, theoretically necessary, while simultaneously showing that their interiors are emergent holograms in the horizons of fundamental surfaces.

The horizon has more reality than the interior. The boundary has more reality than the bulk. The encoder has more reality than the encoded message. Black holes have more reality than space.

And recognizing this is key to understanding the true nature of reality, to finally solving quantum gravity, to grasping that we're living in a holographic projection from cosmic horizons. That's why black holes have more reality than space. And understanding this, truly internalizing that horizons are more fundamental than the space they bound is essential for the next stage of physics for penetrating beyond the illusion of space to the information theoretic reality beneath. Space is the dream.

Horizons are the dreamer. And black holes show us this by being both their horizons are real. Their interiors are emergent dreams more real than the space around them because they're where the fundamental structure of reality is exposed for us to
