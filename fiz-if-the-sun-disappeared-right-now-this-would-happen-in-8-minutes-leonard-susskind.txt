Imagine the sun vanishes. Not explodes, not collapses, simply disappears, gone, removed from the universe as if it never existed. What happens next? Most people have a rough idea.

Everything goes dark. The solar system falls apart. Earth drifts off into interstellar space. Life ends.

All of that is true. But the details, the precise sequence of events, what happens first, what happens second, what the physics actually dictates in each passing second and minute and hour are far more interesting and far more revealing than the simple story. Because this thought experiment is not just an exercise in disaster tourism. It's a window into the deepest structure of physics, into how information travels, into the difference between Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity, into what we mean when we say something is real, into the speed of causality itself.

The eight minutes I'm going to tell you about are eight of the most physics-rich minutes I can imagine. Every second reveals something fundamental about the universe. I've been thinking about light and gravity and causality for 50 years and I still find this scenario genuinely extraordinary. Let me take you through it second by second, minuteby minute with a full precision that physics allows.

Before we start, what does disappear mean? I need to address something right away because a physicist can't just let the sun disappears slide without comment. In the real universe, as we understand it, the sun cannot simply vanish. Energy is conserved.

Mass is conserved. Information is conserved. The sun is 4 * 10 ^ of 30 kg of mostly hydrogen and helium plasma. That mass energy cannot simply cease to exist.

It would violate every conservation law we know. So, this is a thought experiment, a counterfactual. We're asking if by some hypothetical mechanism we don't understand the sun were removed from spacetime at this moment. If it simply ceased to exist at time zero, what would physics dictate for the following minutes and hours and days?

The answer is illuminating precisely because it tests our understanding of how physical influences propagate, of what connects cause to effect, of what the finite speed of light and the finite speed of gravity mean for how information, including gravitational information, travels through spaceime. With that caveat established, let's begin. Time zero, the sun disappears the first 8 minutes. Complete ignorance.

For exactly eight minutes and 20 seconds after the sun vanishes, nothing on Earth changes. Nothing. The sky is still bright. The day continues exactly as it was.

Birds sing. Traffic moves. Crops grow. Your skin is still warm from sunlight.

The photons currently bathing the earth are still arriving, still carrying their energy, still creating the day. This is not a poetic statement. It is a direct consequence of the finite speed of light. Light travels at 300,000 km/s.

The sun is approximately 150 million km from Earth, one astronomical unit or AU. Dividing distance by speed, 150 million divided by 300,000 equals 500 seconds, 8 minutes and 20 seconds. The last photons emitted by the sun at the moment it vanishes are already in transit. They left the sun's surface and began their journey through space at time zero.

For 8 minutes and 20 seconds, those photons travel toward Earth. They arrive. They warm the ground. They power photosynthesis.

They reach your eyes and create the sensation of a normal day. And then they stop. But here's what makes this 8-minute window so extraordinary from a physics standpoint. It's not just light that takes 8 minutes.

Everything takes 8 minutes. Because nothing, no information, no physical influence of any kind can travel faster than light. This is not a technological limitation. It's the structure of spaceime.

The speed of light is not just the speed of electromagnetic radiation. It's the maximum speed of causality itself. What about gravity? Here is where this thought experiment becomes genuinely profound.

And here is where Newton and Einstein part ways dramatically. In Newtonian gravity, force is instantaneous. Newton's law says the gravitational force on Earth depends on the sun's mass and the Earth's sun distance. Right now, the moment the sun vanishes in Newton's theory, Earth's gravitational connection to the sun is instantly severed.

Earth's orbit is instantly disrupted. At time 0 + 1 nancond, Earth is already flying off in a straight line. This is one of the reasons Newton's theory is wrong. In uh Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force.

It's the curvature of spaceime and space-time curvature propagates at the speed of light as gravitational waves. When the sun disappears, the space-time curvature it was maintaining. The curved geometry that keeps Earth in its orbit doesn't vanish instantly. The news of the sun's disappearance must travel outward through spaceime as a pulse of gravitational radiation, a gravitational wave.

This wave moves at exactly the speed of light, 300,000 km/s. Therefore, for exactly 8 minutes and 20 seconds after the sun vanishes, Earth continues orbiting exactly as if the sun was still there. This is extraordinary. Earth orbits a gravitational source that no longer exists.

The space-time curvature maintaining Earth's orbit is real. It's producing real centripal acceleration on the earth. But the sun that created that curvature is gone. Earth is orbiting a ghost, a memory in the geometry of spacetime.

I love this result. It reveals something deep about what gravity actually is. In Newtonian physics, gravity is a force between objects. If the source object vanishes, the force vanishes.

In general relativity, gravity is a geometric feature of spacetime. The space-time curvature exists independently of the source. It takes time for the curvature to relax after the source is removed. Second 0 to second 10, the gravitational wave.

At the moment the sun vanishes, a gravitational wave, more precisely, a complex pulse of space-time curvature begins propagating outward from where the sun was. This is not the periodic gravitational waves we detect from binary black hole mergers. Those are sinosoidal. This is a step function in space-time curvature.

A pulse. As it passes through space, it marks the transition between suncurved spacetime and flat spacetime. Before the pulse, spaceime is curved by the Sunday. After the pulse passes, that curvature is gone.

The wave expands outward at the speed of light, a sphere of transition, growing at 300,000 km/s. At 10 seconds after the sun disappears, this gravitational wave is 3 million km from where the sun was. That's about 4% of the Earth's sun distance. The innermost regions of the solar system, the space very close to where Mercury orbits, are just beginning to receive the news.

The geometry of spaceime is already changing in those inner regions. But for us, eight light minutes away, nothing has changed yet. Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, orbits at an average of about 58 million km. Light takes about 3 minutes and 13 seconds to travel from where the sun was to Mercury.

So, Mercury will receive the gravitational news in 3 minutes and 13 seconds. Minute one, the first signals. One minute after the sun disappears, the gravitational pulse has traveled 18 million kilometers. It's still far from any planet.

But something else is happening that almost nobody talks about in these discussions. Nutrinos. The sun is a prodigious producer of nutrinos. In the core of the sun, where hydrogen fuses into helium, hundreds of trillions of nutrinos are produced every second.

These nutrinos almost never interact with matter. They stream freely through the sun's interior, which takes them about 2 seconds to traverse, then out into space. At any moment, approximately 65 billion solar nutrinos are passing through every square cimeter of your body every second. You are bathed in them constantly.

They pass through you, through the earth, through everything, barely interacting. At time zero, the solar core disappears. The nutrino source vanishes. But just like photons, the last nutrinos emitted by the sun at time zero are already in transit.

They are at this moment streaming outward at nearly the speed of light. Here's an interesting subtlety. Nutrinos travel at very close to but not exactly the speed of light. They have a tiny mass.

We know this because different nutrino flavors oscillate between types which requires mass. This mass means they travel infinite decimally slower than light. For practical purposes, this difference is negligible. The arrival time difference between the last solar nutrinos and the last solar photons would be measured in microsconds.

So at minute one, Earth still basks in sunlight. Earth's orbit is unchanged. The gravitational wave pulse is still far away. The last solar nutrinos are streaming toward us, indistinguishable from normal.

Nothing on Earth has changed. Minute 3, Mercury goes dark and free. 3 minutes and 13 seconds after the sun disappears, the gravitational pulse reaches Mercury. In the preceding 3 minutes and 13 seconds, Mercury has been in a strange situation.

It was orbiting the sun as normal. The space-time curvature maintaining its orbit was intact. But Mercury itself had already experienced the optical loss of the sun because Mercury is closer and receives light faster. Wait, no, let me be precise.

The light travel time from Sun to Mercury is 3 minutes and 13 seconds. The gravitational travel time is also 3 minutes and 13 seconds. They're the same speed. So, the optical and gravitational news arrive at Mercury simultaneously.

At exactly 3 minutes and 13 seconds, two things happen to Mercury at the same moment. The last sunlight arrives and the space-time curvature shifts. Mercury goes simultaneously dark and free. From this moment, Mercury is no longer in orbit.

It's traveling in a straight line at its orbital velocity approximately 47 km/s tangent to its former orbit. It's free, unbound, leaving the solar system. Mercury's orbital speed of 47 km/s sounds fast, and it is. It's faster than any human spacecraft, but the solar system is vast.

At this speed, it would take Mercury about 10,000 years to travel one lightyear, minute 8, everything changes. 8 minutes and 20 seconds after the sun disappears, the gravitational pulse arrives at Earth's orbit. At this exact moment, two things happen simultaneously that reshape everything. First, the last photons from the sun arrive.

The sky goes dark, not instantaneously. Different parts of the sky still show light from stars, but the brilliant sun, which was just there, is gone. The dayside of Earth goes from full daylight to night in an instant, from 1,360 watts per square meter of solar radiance to zero. The temperature effects take longer the atmosphere and oceans have thermal mass and won't cool immediately.

But uh the direct solar radiation stops. Second, Earth's orbit is disrupted. The space-time curvature maintaining Earth's orbit is replaced by flat spacetime as the gravitational pulse passes. Earth is now moving in a straight line at its orbital velocity approximately 30 kilometers/s tangent to its former orbit.

Earth at this moment becomes an unbound object. It will never return to its former orbit. It's not flung outward violently. There's no explosion.

It simply continues moving in the direction it was heading with no centrial force to curve its path. It moves in a straight line into interstellar space. This is the most important moment. But let me dwell on it because there's something subtle here that most explanations miss.

The smoothness of the uh transition. When the gravitational wave pulse passes Earth and the curvature shifts, does Earth jolt? Does it feel a sudden change? This is a fascinating question and the answer depends on the nature of the gravitational wave pulse.

In general relativity, gravitational waves are transverse waves. They stretch and compress space perpendicular to their direction of travel. As the pulse passes Earth, Earth would briefly experience tidal forces, different parts of Earth being stretched and compressed relative to each other. But the pulse we're describing, the relaxation of the sun's gravitational field is not a simple sinosidal gravitational wave.

It's more complex. It's a transition from curved spacetime to flat spacetime. In the geodessic deviation equations, what matters is the remon curvature tensor at Earth's location. Before the pulse, remon curvature from the sun's gravitational field.

After the pulse, flat spacetime, essentially zero remon curvature. During the pulse, a brief complex transition. The transition would be felt as a brief gravitational pulse tidal forces that stretch and compress Earth. The duration of this pulse would be the time for the wave packet to pass Earth, which depends on how sharply the sun's disappearance occurred.

If the sun disappeared instantaneously, which as I noted can't happen in real physics, the pulse would be infinitely sharp, a direct delta function in time. Earth would experience an instantaneous tidal impulse. More realistically, if the disappearance took any finite time, the pulse would be broadened accordingly. The tidal effect would last as long as the transition.

In either case, after the pulse passes, Earth is in flat spacetime moving in a straight line. The orbit is over. The first hour, darkness and cold begin. For the first hour after the sun disappears, from Earth's perspective, the consequences are stark but still survivable.

Temperature. The Earth's surface begins to cool, but the atmosphere and oceans are massive thermal reservoirs. The atmosphere with its greenhouse gases will trap the existing heat. The oceans will take months to years to freeze significantly.

In the first hour, average global temperature drops by perhaps a degree or two. Uncomfortable, but not lethal. The immediate danger is not cold. It's darkness.

Light. Complete darkness on the dayside is instant at minute 8. But cities have power grids. Buildings have heat.

Nuclear power plants don't need sunlight. In the first hour, human civilization is severely disrupted, but not destroyed. Biological effects. Photosynthesis stops immediately.

Plants don't die instantly. They have energy reserves. But the process of energy production from sunlight is over. The entire food chain, which ultimately depends on photosynthesis, begins a slow terminal decline.

Animals that depend on daylight for behavior, for hunting, navigation, reproduction are immediately disrupted. Circadian rhythms are disrupted for all life on Earth. The planet enters a permanent night. Aurora.

Interestingly, the aurora would continue for a while. The solar wind takes longer to cease the streaming of charged particles from the sun would take a few days to stop arriving at Earth after the sun vanished. So for the first days, the northern and southern lights would continue powered by the last gasps of solar wind. The first day, geological implications.

24 hours in, the consequences deepen. The sun was not just a heat source. It was a gravitational anchor. Without its gravity, Earth is no longer in a stable orbit.

But it's also no longer experiencing solar tides. Solar tides, the slight stretching of Earth toward and away from the sun, would cease. This would cause small but detectable changes in Earth's shape. Tidal stresses on rocks, on the oceans, on geological structures would shift.

Minor seismic effects would follow. The moon is still present. Lunar gravity is unchanged. Earth still experiences tidal forces from the moon.

And the moon is still in orbit around Earth. The Earth moon gravitational system is unaffected by the sun's disappearance. The moon will continue to orbit Earth for billions of years. This is important.

The moon is not going anywhere. And the moon provides tidal forces that maintain Earth's rotational stability. Without the sun, Earth's axial tilt would slowly destabilize over millions of years due to other planetary perturbations. But on short time scales, thousands of years, the moon maintains it.

Temperature after 24 hours, average global surface temperature is perhaps 10° below the pre-un baseline. Still survivable for humans in appropriate shelter. Tropical regions might still be around 15° C. Arctic regions would drop precipitously.

The first week, the solar system dissolves. Within a week of the sun's disappearance, the gravitational pulse has reached the outer planets. Jupiter at five astronomical units from the sun receives the gravitational news in about 42 minutes. Saturn at 10 AU in about 83 minutes.

Uranus and Neptune further out in 2 to four hours. Each planet when the pulse arrives goes from orbiting to moving in a straight line. The solar system literally dissolves. Eight planets, dozens of moons, billions of asteroids and comets, all of them heading off in random straight line trajectories into interstellar space.

The solar system, which took 4.6 billion years to form, disperses in hours. The geometry of orbits, the elegant ellipses maintained by space-time curvature, all become straight lines. The solar system is just a collection of rocks and gases heading off in different directions. From Earth's perspective, the night sky changes.

The planets which had moved predictably against the starfield are now moving differently. Their positions shift as they drift away. Eventually over months and years they would move to different parts of the sky then fade as they recede. The first month the race against cold.

A month after the sun disappears the surface of the earth has cooled dramatically. Average global surface temperature approximately -20° C. This is below the freezing point of water uh across most of the planet. Tropical regions might still be above freezing barely but most of the surface is in a deep freeze.

Snow and ice are forming at unprecedented rates. The albdo, the reflectivity of the earth's surface, increases as ice covers more area. This creates a feedback loop. More ice reflects more sunlight.

Except there is no sunlight. More ice means more thermal radiation is trapped. The cooling accelerates. But here's something remarkable that uh might give life a fighting chance.

Geothermal heat. The Earth's interior is hot, incredibly hot. The core is approximately 5,000° C, as hot as the surface of the Sunday. This heat comes from two sources.

Residual heat from the Earth's formation 4 1/2 billion years ago, and ongoing radioactive decay of isotopes like uranium 238, thorium 232, and potassium 40. This heat flows outward through the mantle and crust emerging at the surface at about 90 matts per square meter. Uh that's tiny compared to the 1,360 watts per square meter we receive from the Sunday, but it's not nothing. Around hydrothermal vents, both in the ocean and on land, geothermal heat is much higher.

These are places where Earth's internal heat reaches the surface directly. And around these vents, life might survive indefinitely. The first year, survivors and the frozen world. A year after the sun's disappearance, the world is almost unrecognizable.

The surface is frozen. Average temperatures are around -60° C, comparable to the South Pole today. But everywhere, ice covers all of the oceans. The atmosphere begins to change as carbon dioxide, which was previously regulated by ocean chemistry and biological activity, accumulates from volcanic activity and decreases as photosynthesis stops.

Eventually, in decades, the atmosphere itself begins to freeze. Nitrogen freezes at -210° C. Oxygen freezes at -219. These temperatures won't be reached quickly.

The geothermal heat and residual atmospheric heat keep things above these extremes for thousands of years. But carbon dioxide freezes at -78° C. Within a century, CO2 begins depositing as dry ice on the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner.

Human civilization. If we received warning, if we somehow knew the sun would disappear, humans might have prepared. underground bunkers near geothermal hotspots, nuclear reactors providing heat and power, hydroponic agriculture in heated chambers. Uh enough food stored to last generations while new systems are established without warning, which is the scenario we're considering.

Civilization collapses within months as food production fails, energy grids fall apart, and the cold becomes murderous. But small communities near geothermal hotspots, Iceland, Yellowstone, the hydrothermal vents under the oceans might survive. They would live underground, heated by the Earth's interior, farming in artificial light from nuclear power, fishing in the warm waters near submarine vents. A thousand years equilibrium.

In a thousand years, Earth has reached a new equilibrium. The surface temperature is around -240° C within 30° of absolute zero. The oceans are frozen solid to great depths. Most of the atmosphere has frozen and precipitated.

Earth's surface is a frozen wasteland under a thin residual atmosphere. But the deep ocean near hydrothermal vents is warm, maybe 10° C. Liquid water, energy from the Earth's interior. And if microbial life survived, which it likely would, given how robust extreophiles are, ecosystems exist around these vents, perhaps even complex multisellular life if evolution is fast enough and conditions stable enough.

This is not a hypothetical. We know that hydrothermal vent ecosystems on Earth today are entirely independent of sunlight. They run on chemosynthesis, chemical energy from the vent fluids rather than photosynthesis. tubeworms, crabs, shrimp, fish, microbes, entire ecosystems with no connection to the Sunday.

These ecosystems would survive and in the deep, dark, frozen earth, they would be the only ecosystems. Earth a billion years hence might have a rich biosphere entirely confined to the deep ventwarmed ocean. Life finding a way as it always does. what this tells us about physics.

Let me step back from the narrative and tell you what this thought experiment actually reveals about the laws of physics. First, the speed of causality. Information, any information, gravitational or electromagnetic or any other kind, travels at most at the speed of light. This is not just about light.

It's about the maximum rate at which cause can precede effect. The 8minute delay is not an inconvenience. It's a fundamental feature of spacetime. Second, gravity is geometry, not force.

The fact that Earth continues orbiting for 8 minutes after the sun vanishes, orbiting a gravitational source that no longer exists, is only possible because gravity is space-time curvature. And space-time curvature propagates, and the curvature already in place at Earth's location continues to exist for 8 minutes until the news of the sun's departure arrives. In Newton's theory, this couldn't happen. Newton's gravity is instantaneous.

the orbit would fail immediately. Newton's theory gives the wrong answer for this thought experiment. General relativity gives the right one. Third, the conservation laws are absolute.

The sun cannot simply vanish in any real physical scenario because energy and information are conserved. This thought experiment requires violating physics to set up. The interesting physics is what happens after we've accepted that violation. And what happens reveals how the real laws operate, how quickly information propagates, what depends on what, which effects are local and which are global.

Fourth, the interconnectedness of the solar system. Every planet, every moon, every asteroid is connected to every other through gravitational space-time geometry. The sun's disappearance creates a gravitational wave that propagates outward, delivering news to each object in sequence, dissolving the solar system not all at once, but in precise temporal order according to distance and the speed of light. The solar system has a light crossing time about 11 hours from the sun to the outermost reaches of the Kyper belt.

For 11 hours after the sun vanishes, different parts of the solar system are in different states simultaneously. Inner planets are free and dark. Outer planets are still blissfully orbiting. A wave of dissolution moves outward at 300,000 km/s, dissolving everything it touches.

The nutrino window. Let me come back to nutrinos because they deserve more attention. I mentioned that solar nutrinos stream through you constantly, 65 billion per square cm/s. They pass through the earth as if it were transparent.

They interact only via the weak nuclear force which makes their interaction probability vanishingly small. These nutrinos come from the nuclear reactions in the sun's core, not from the surface where light is generated from the core. Because nutrinos barely interact with matter, they escape the core immediately. While photons created in nuclear reactions take about a 100,000 years to diffuse from the core to the surface through repeated absorption and remission.

This means the photons leaving the sun's surface right now were actually generated about 100,000 years ago in the core. They've been bouncing around inside the sun for 100,000 years. When the sun vanishes, the last nutrinos from the core are already in transit. They left the core and were heading toward Earth at nearly the speed of light.

They arrive about 8 minutes and 20 seconds after the sun disappears. But the last photons leaving the sun's surface at the moment of disappearance are photons that were generated in the core 100,000 years ago. The photon stream will continue for a 100,000 years after the sun disappears. Photons that were generated before the sun vanished will continue to leave.

Except wait, the sun has vanished. There's no surface from which photons emerge. The photons still bouncing around inside the sun at the moment of disappearance are gone with a Sunday. Only the photons already in transit already escaped from the sun's surface continue their journey.

So the 8 minutes of normal sunlight we receive is truly the last. The photons in transit at the moment of disappearance, after 8 minutes, nothing. But here's a profound thought. For a 100,000 years before this moment, the photons arriving at Earth were generated in a sun whose core state was a 100,000 years ago.

The sunlight you see today is ancient information. The sun's surface, you see, is ancient news. The sun could have undergone changes in its core 100,000 years ago and we wouldn't know it from the light. The nutrinos, by contrast, give us realtime information about the sun's core.

When nutrino detectors like Super Kameio in Japan see a drop in solar nutrinos, that's a near realtime signal from the solar interior. The nutrinos we detect today left the sun's core 8 minutes ago. This is why nutrino astronomy is so powerful and why the observation of solar nutrinos first accomplished by Raymond Davis in the 1960s was such a triumph. We were seeing the sun's interior in real time for the first time.

The philosophical dimension. This thought experiment has a philosophical dimension that I find as interesting as the physics. It illustrates with visceral clarity what it means for information to travel at a finite speed. Right now, as you watch this video, you are seeing the universe as it was, not as it is.

The stars you see at night are not where they are now. They're where they were years, decades, centuries, millennia ago. When the light now reaching your eyes left them, some of those stars might no longer exist. You're looking at the ghosts.

The sun, you see, is 8 minutes old. The moon is a little over a second old. Jupiter is between 35 and 52 minutes old, depending on where it is in its orbit. The nearest star, Proxima Centuri, is 4 years and 3 months old.

And the edge of the observable universe, the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, is 13.8 billion years old. You're looking at the universe as it was 13.8 billion years ago, as near as possible to the very beginning. This is not a limitation of our telescopes. It's a fundamental feature of physics.

Causality travels at the speed of light. You can never see the universe as it is right now. You can only see it as it was with the time lag determined by distance and the speed of light. This has a profound implication.

You are not in contact with the present universe. You are in contact with the past. The present universe. What everything is doing right now at this instant is forever beyond your observational reach.

You live in a very real sense surrounded by the past embedded in a cocoon of information that left its sources at various times in the past and has just now arrived at your eyes and ears and instruments. The sun disappearing thought experiment makes this viscerally real. For 8 minutes, you would be sitting in sunlight, warm and illuminated, with no idea that the source of that light and warmth had ceased to exist. You would be living in a world that was already gone.

And that's not hypothetical. That's the situation you're always in to varying degrees. The universe around you is always a snapshot of the past, not the present. The question of gravitational waves.

When the sun disappears, it generates a gravitational wave. I mentioned this but let me go deeper because it connects to some of the most exciting recent developments in observational physics. In 2015, LIGO detected gravitational waves for the first time, ripples in spaceime from the merger of two black holes a billion light years away. This was one of the greatest observational achievements in history.

We confirmed that spaceime can ripple, that these ripples propagate at the speed of light, and that we can detect them. The gravitational wave from the sun disappearing would be different from what LIGO detected. LIGO detects periodic waves from binary systems spiraling together, sustained oscillations lasting seconds to minutes. The sun's disappearance would produce a single pulse.

This pulse would be enormous by solar system standards. The strain, the fractional change in the distance between two points as the wave passes would be significant at Earth's distance. Far larger than the strain from the distant black hole merges LIGO has detected, but it would be over quickly. A pulse, a single disturbance in spaceime, marking the transition from the sun's gravitational presence to its absence.

LIGO would detect this pulse with enormous signal strength. So would any other gravitational wave detector. In fact, the signal would be so strong it would saturate the detectors, they'd be overwhelmed by a disturbance orders of magnitude larger than anything they were designed to measure. And of course, 8 minutes before LIGO detected this pulse, it would already know something was wrong because the light from the sun would have stopped 8 minutes earlier.

The coincidence, sudden darkness followed precisely 8 minutes and 20 seconds later by a massive gravitational wave pulse would confirm to any physicist watching that the sun had vanished. The two signals, electromagnetic and gravitational, traveling at the same speed, marking the same event, arriving in the same sequence that general relativity predicts. It would be a perfect experimental confirmation of general relativity. Too bad there'd be no physicists around to appreciate it within a few months.

What survives? Let me end on something slightly less bleak than universal death. Life is extraordinarily robust. It has survived every mass extinction in Earth's history.

It survived the Chickixel impact that killed the dinosaurs. It survived the great oxidation event, the snowball earth glaciations, the peran extinction that killed 96% of all species. Without the sun, surface life dies. That's nearly certain.

But deep life, life in the subsurface, uh life around hydrothermal vents, uh microbial life in deep rock, this might survive essentially indefinitely. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are powered entirely by Earth's internal heat and chemistry. No sunlight required. The tube worms and sulfur bacteria and chemosynthetic microbes at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean have never needed the Sunday.

They would continue unaware that anything had changed. Geothermal heat will continue for billions of years. The radioactive decay powering Earth's interior is independent of the Sunday uranium. 238 has a half-life of 4 and a half billion years.

As long as that decay continues, Earth will have internal heat. Earth will have liquid water in its deep interior. Life will persist. And life, given billions of years and liquid water and chemical energy and selective pressure, does things we can't predict.

It evolves. It adapts. It finds new niches. In a billion years, deep in the frozen earth around geothermal vents, in an ocean under kilometers of ice, what might evolution have produced?

What biochemistry might have emerged? What complexity? We don't know. We can't know.

But the history of life on Earth suggests that life once started is extraordinarily hard to stop. Even by removing the Sunday conclusion, 8 minutes. That's how long it takes for the news to arrive. For eight minutes, you would live in a world that had already ended.

In sunlight from a source that no longer existed, in the gravitational embrace of a star that had vanished. Every second of those 8 minutes would be alone from the past, repayable only in darkness and cold and the slow dissolution of the solar system. And those eight minutes would teach you viscerally something that 50 years of physics has made clear to me intellectually. Causality is finite.

Information travels at the speed of light. The universe you experience is always the universe as it was, not as it is. The sun would be gone, but its light would still warm you. Its gravity would still hold you for eight extraordinary physics, profoundly revealing minutes.

And then the news would arrive and everything would change. That's what happens when the sun disappears. And that's what the laws of physics look like when you push them to their limits.
